# Financial Tools Data Map

> Reference: Which Supabase tables power each financial tool page, and what Acumatica data maps to them.

---

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### 1. Budget
**Supabase tables:** `budget_lines`, `v_budget_lines` (view), `direct_cost_line_items`, `subcontract_sov_items`, `purchase_order_sov_items`, `change_order_lines`, `commitment_change_order_lines`
**Acumatica sync:** None active. Staging table `acumatica_project_budgets` exists for comparison (used by AI financial insights).

### 2. Prime Contracts
**Supabase tables:** `prime_contracts`, `contract_line_items`, `contract_change_orders`, `prime_contract_payment_applications`, `prime_contract_payments`
**Acumatica sync:** None active.
- `prime_contract_payment_applications` = billing draws submitted against the prime contract (AIA G702/G703 style — period, amount, retention, net)
- `prime_contract_payments` = actual cash received from the owner against those applications

### 3. Commitments
**Supabase tables:** `commitments_unified` (view), `subcontracts_with_totals` (view), `purchase_orders_with_totals` (view)
**Acumatica sync:** `erp_status` column exists. Staging tables `acumatica_subcontracts` and `acumatica_purchase_orders` exist but no active sync button.

### 4. Change Events
**Supabase tables:** `change_events`
**Acumatica sync:** None. Entirely native.

### 5. Change Orders
**Supabase tables:** `change_orders` (commitment COs), `prime_contract_change_orders` (PCCOs), `contract_change_orders`
**Acumatica sync:** `acumatica_external_key` columns exist. Staging table `acumatica_change_orders` exists. No active sync button.

### 6. Direct Costs
**Supabase tables:** `direct_costs`, `direct_cost_line_items`, `cost_codes`
**Acumatica sync:** **YES — Active sync button.** Pulls AP Bills from Acumatica into `direct_costs` via `POST /api/sync/acumatica/direct-costs`. Also mirrors raw data to `acumatica_ap_bills` + `acumatica_ap_bill_lines` staging tables.

### 7. Invoicing
**Supabase tables:** `owner_invoices`, `owner_invoice_line_items`, joined through `contracts` for project scoping
**Acumatica sync:** None active. Staging tables `acumatica_ar_invoices` + `acumatica_ar_invoice_lines` exist.

## Two-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Direct sync into app tables (active, writes to production tables)

Only **two entities** are actively synced today:

| Acumatica Entity | Supabase App Table | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Vendors | `vendors` (upsert by `acumatica_vendor_id`) | Sync button on Vendors/Companies page |
| AP Bills | `direct_costs` (upsert by `acumatica_ref_nbr`) | Sync button on Direct Costs page |

### Layer 2: Raw ERP staging tables (schema exists, no active UI sync)

These `acumatica_*` tables were created by migrations but **no UI buttons trigger them yet**:

| Staging Table | Acumatica Source | Acumatica API Endpoint | Potential App Table Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `acumatica_ar_invoices` + `_lines` | AR Invoices | `ARInvoice` | `owner_invoices` / `owner_invoice_line_items` |
| `acumatica_ap_bills` + `_lines` | AP Bills | `Bill` | `direct_costs` (already synced via Layer 1) |
| `acumatica_checks` | AP Checks/Payments | `Check` | `payment_transactions` or new |
| `acumatica_project_budgets` | Project Budget | `ProjectBudget` | `budget_lines` (comparison only today) |
| `acumatica_change_orders` | Change Orders | `ChangeOrder` | `change_orders` / `contract_change_orders` |
| `acumatica_subcontracts` | Subcontracts | `Subcontract` | subcontracts (via `commitments_unified`) |
| `acumatica_purchase_orders` | Purchase Orders | `PurchaseOrder` | purchase orders (via `commitments_unified`) |
| `acumatica_payments` | AR Payments | `Payment` | `prime_contract_payments` |

## What's NOT in Acumatica

These are Alleato-native only (no ERP equivalent):

- **Change Events** — internal tracking of potential changes before they become COs
- **RFIs, Submittals, Specs** — document management tools
- **Schedule** — project scheduling
- **Directory** — people/company management (though vendors sync)
- **Meetings, Daily Logs** — field operations
