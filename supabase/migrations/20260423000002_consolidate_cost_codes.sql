-- Consolidates project_cost_codes into project_budget_codes so that
-- budget lines and contract SOV items reference the same table.
-- Reverses the band-aid applied in migration 20260317000005.

-- 1. Make cost_type_id nullable on project_budget_codes.
--    Acumatica sync creates entries without a cost type.
ALTER TABLE project_budget_codes

-- 2. Migrate project_cost_codes rows into project_budget_codes.
--    DISTINCT ON deduplicates pcc entries with the same (project_id, cost_code_id, cost_type_id).
--    Skip rows that already exist in project_budget_codes.
