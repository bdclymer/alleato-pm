-- Company-wide employee permission templates
--
-- The user-management UI separates project-limited templates from company-wide
-- templates. Template names therefore need to be unique within a scope, not
-- globally, so employees can choose "Project Manager" for all projects or for
-- specific projects without learning a second naming system.
