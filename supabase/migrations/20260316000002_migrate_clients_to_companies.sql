-- Migrate clients table into companies table (type = 'client')
-- Drops the separate clients table and updates all FK references to use companies.id (uuid)
-- Affected tables: projects, prime_contracts, contracts, prospects

-- 1. Mark existing linked companies as type='client'
UPDATE companies c SET type = 'client' FROM clients cl WHERE cl.company_id = c.id;

-- 2. Create company records for clients that had no company_id
INSERT INTO companies (name, type, status)
SELECT DISTINCT ON (name) name, 'client', COALESCE(status, 'active')
FROM clients WHERE company_id IS NULL AND name IS NOT NULL;

-- 3. Link new companies back to clients
UPDATE clients cl SET company_id = c.id
FROM companies c
WHERE cl.company_id IS NULL AND cl.name IS NOT NULL AND c.name = cl.name AND c.type = 'client';

-- 4. Drop dependent views + trigger
DROP TRIGGER trg_sync_client ON projects;
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW contract_financial_summary_mv;
DROP VIEW contract_financial_summary;
DROP VIEW prime_contract_financial_summary;
DROP VIEW projects_with_counts;

-- 5. Migrate projects.client_id (bigint -> uuid)
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN client_company_id uuid REFERENCES companies(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE;
UPDATE projects p SET client_company_id = cl.company_id FROM clients cl WHERE p.client_id = cl.id;
ALTER TABLE projects DROP COLUMN client_id;
ALTER TABLE projects RENAME COLUMN client_company_id TO client_id;

-- 6. Update sync_client to use companies
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.sync_client() RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
  SELECT name INTO NEW.client FROM public.companies WHERE id = NEW.client_id;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
CREATE TRIGGER trg_sync_client BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF client_id ON public.projects
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_client();
