-- Split retainage into Work vs Materials on subcontractor invoice line items.
-- Procore's G703 tracks work retainage and materials retainage as independent
-- lines with their own % and $ columns. The existing retainage_pct/amount
-- columns are repurposed as WORK retainage (no data migration needed — they
-- already represent work-completed retainage on every active invoice).

-- Drop the generated net_amount column so we can recompute it with both retainages.
