-- Add UPDATE RLS policy to projects table
--
-- BUG: Budget lock/unlock feature was returning 403 Forbidden because
-- the projects table had no UPDATE RLS policy. The Supabase auth client
-- could not update budget_locked, budget_locked_at, budget_locked_by columns.
--
-- The API route already checks requirePermission(projectId, "budget", "admin")
-- before reaching the Supabase UPDATE call, so the RLS policy can be permissive
-- for authenticated users — permission enforcement happens at the API layer.

CREATE POLICY "projects_update_budget_lock_authenticated"
ON projects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
