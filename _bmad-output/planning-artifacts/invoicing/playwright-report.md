# Playwright Test Report - Invoicing

**Status:** Report not generated yet - tests blocked by build errors

## How to Generate Report

Once build errors are fixed, run:

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test tests/e2e/invoicing.spec.ts --reporter=html
```text
The HTML report will be saved to `tests/playwright-report/index.html`

Copy it here for project management tracking:

```bash
cp -r tests/playwright-report/* documentation/*project-mgmt/active/invoicing/playwright-report/
```

## Current Blockers

2. **Auth Setup:** `/dev-login` route doesn't exist
3. **Dev Server:** Returns 404 for `/67/invoicing` due to build errors
