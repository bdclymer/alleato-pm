# Prime Contracts Comparison - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2026-01-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **SIGNIFICANT GAPS FOUND**
**Procore Match Score:** 40.8% (Grade: F)

---

## 🎯 Quick Facts

- **Procore Columns:** 18 critical columns
- **Implementation:** 9 columns (50%)
- **Missing:** 9 critical columns including ALL financial calculations
- **Critical Issues:** 5 blocking issues requiring database migrations

---

## 🚨 Top 5 Critical Issues

### 1. ❌ Wrong Entity Type (BLOCKER)

**Problem:** Implementation uses `vendor_id` but Prime Contracts should use **Owner/Client** (the entity paying the contractor, not receiving payment).

**Impact:** Fundamental data model error - vendors are suppliers/subs, owners/clients are customers

**Fix Required:** Database migration to rename column + update all references

---

### 2. ❌ Missing ALL Financial Calculations (BLOCKER)

**Missing Columns:**

- Approved Change Orders (calculated)
- Pending Change Orders (calculated)
- Draft Change Orders (calculated)
- Invoiced (calculated)
- Payments Received (calculated)
- % Paid (calculated)
- Remaining Balance Outstanding (calculated)

**Impact:** Cannot track contract financial progress - table is essentially broken for financial management

**Fix Required:** Create database view with aggregations + add 7 calculated columns

---

### 3. ❌ Missing "Executed" Field (BLOCKER)

**Problem:** No way to mark a contract as executed/signed

**Impact:** Cannot control workflow or track contract lifecycle properly

**Fix Required:** Add `executed_at` timestamp column + add checkbox to form + add boolean display to table

---

### 4. ❌ Revised Contract Value Not Calculated (BLOCKER)

**Problem:** Procore calculates `Revised Contract = Original + Approved Change Orders` automatically, but implementation allows manual entry

**Impact:** Data integrity issue - revised value can diverge from actual

**Fix Required:** Make field computed-only (read-only), calculate from change orders

---

### 5. ❌ No Payment/Invoice Infrastructure (BLOCKER)

**Problem:** Missing ability to track invoices and payments

**Impact:** Cannot calculate % Paid, Remaining Balance, or Invoiced columns

**Fix Required:** Ensure `owner_invoices` and `payment_transactions` tables exist + add aggregations

## ⏱️ Estimated Effort to Fix

| Phase | Tasks | Hours | Priority |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Phase 1: Critical Fixes** | Fix entity type, add executed, add financial calculations, add payment tracking | 10-12h | 🔴 **REQUIRED** |
| **Phase 2: Additional Fields** | Add missing date fields, privacy controls | 3-4h | 🟡 **NICE-TO-HAVE** |
| **Phase 3: Polish** | Fix status workflow, add attachments count | 2-3h | 🟢 **OPTIONAL** |

**Total to 80% Match:** 10-12 hours
**Total to 100% Match:** 15-18 hours

## 🎯 Recommendation

**DO NOT FIX IMMEDIATELY** - These changes require:

1. Database migrations (risky)
2. Data model refactoring (vendor → client)
3. Financial infrastructure (invoice/payment tracking)
4. Potentially breaking existing data

**Recommended Approach:**

1. Get user approval for scope of changes
2. Create detailed migration plan
3. Backup existing data
4. Implement in phases with testing between each
5. Run E2E tests after each phase

**Unlike Direct Costs (which were just UI/validation fixes), Prime Contracts requires fundamental data model changes.**

## ✅ What's Working

- ✅ Basic CRUD operations
- ✅ Table displays contracts
- ✅ Form allows creation/editing
- ✅ Core fields present (number, title, dates, amounts)
- ✅ Schedule of Values implementation
- ✅ Related tables exist (change orders, SOVs)

---

## ❌ What's Broken/Missing

- ❌ Wrong business entity (vendor vs client)
- ❌ No financial calculations at all
- ❌ No payment tracking
- ❌ No invoice tracking
- ❌ Revised contract manually editable (should be calculated)
- ❌ Missing critical workflow states
- ❌ No privacy controls
- ❌ 50% of Procore table columns missing

**Next Step:** Await user decision on whether to proceed with fixes given the scope and risk.
