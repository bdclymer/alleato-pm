# Procore Module: scheduling

## Purpose

This directory contains **crawler output and reports** for the Procore **scheduling** tool.

This module is part of a larger system designed to:

- Observe Procore functionality
- Extract UI and behavioral intelligence
- Ingest structured data into Supabase
- Enable accurate rebuilding and parity analysis

## How This Module Is Used

1. A Playwright crawler targets the Procore **scheduling** tool
2. Pages are captured into `pages/`
3. Reports are generated into `reports/`
4. The ETL script ingests this data into Supabase using:

   ```bash
   PROCORE_MODULE=scheduling node etl/etl_ingest_procore_crawl.js
   ```

## Notes

- This folder represents **explicit intent** to crawl and model this Procore tool
- Structure should not be modified by ETL scripts
- Add tool-specific notes here as discoveries are made
