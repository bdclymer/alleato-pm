"""LLM-driven rewrite for Fireflies meeting action items.

Fireflies emits action-item lines that are usually third-person narration
("Provide support to Brandon...", "Inform Maria once X..."). When those land
in the tasks table verbatim, the assignee picked by a regex is almost always
the person being talked ABOUT, not the person who should DO the work.

This module replaces the regex path. It feeds Fireflies action items plus the
meeting context (participants, speaker→email map, source date) to an LLM
prompt that:

- rewrites every kept item into a short imperative task title + a longer
  description grounded in the source context,
- assigns ownership to the doer (must be one of the meeting participants),
- drops items where ownership is ambiguous or the action is not real work,
- enforces the same internal-employee-only rule used by `task_extraction.py`
  and `teams_compiler.py`.

The output is a list of dicts ready for `Store.upsert_task`, including
`title`, `description`, `assignee_name`, `assignee_email`, `assigned_by`,
`due_date`, `priority`, `extraction_prompt_version`, and `extraction_metadata`.

_REWRITER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You convert Fireflies meeting action-item lines into clean, owner-assigned
tasks for a construction PM tool. Fireflies writes action items as third-person
narration ("X to provide…", "Inform Y about…"). Your job is to rewrite each
real action item as an IMPERATIVE task assigned to the person who must DO it.

# Title rules
- ≤ 10 words. Start with an action verb. Be specific about the artifact, deliverable, or next step.
- Never narrate. Never use "X asked Y", "Provide X to <Name>", "Inform <Name>", "Coordinate with <Name>" framing.
- The title must read as the OWNER's to-do, not as a description of what happened.

# Description rules
- 1–2 sentences. Imperative form. Include any concrete artifact, deadline, dollar amount, project, or counterparty mentioned.
- Same anti-narration rule as the title.

# Owner rules (CRITICAL)
- The owner is the person who must DO the work, never the person being talked ABOUT.
- "Provide support to Brandon" → owner is the person providing support, NOT Brandon.
- "Inform Maria when X is ready" → owner is the informer, NOT Maria.
- "Coordinate with Sarah on contract edits" → owner is the coordinator, NOT Sarah.
- "Send updated CAD to Joe" → owner is the sender, NOT Joe.
- Owner MUST be one of the named participants/speakers provided to you. If the doer cannot be confidently identified from the action item or surrounding context, set "assignee_name" to null and the task will be discarded — DO NOT default to the first named person.
- Owner is the doer; "assigned_by" is the person who directed the work (set to null for self-commitments).

# Filter rules — emit [] for items like:
- Calendar/Teams logistics: forwarding/accepting/declining invites, RSVPing, joining a call, screen sharing.
- Sub-2-minute micro-actions: acknowledging receipt, opening a link, adding someone to a chat.
- Pure information consumption: "review the attached doc" with no follow-up artifact.
- Generic "team should…" or "we need to…" with no concrete owner.
- Vendor/client/architect/inspector actions — emit those as project intelligence elsewhere, never as tasks here.

# Rewrite examples
- Bad: "Provide support and coaching to Brandon Clymer regarding the blender deluge fire suppression system as needed"
  Good: { "title": "Coach Brandon on blender deluge system", "description": "Provide ongoing technical coaching to Brandon on the blender deluge fire suppression system as questions come up.", "assignee_name": "<actual speaker who committed to this>", "confidence": 0.7 }
  If the speaker who committed cannot be identified, DROP the task entirely.
- Bad: "Inform Brandon once Ben's answers to outstanding questions are ready and facilitate ongoing communication between parties"
  Good: { "title": "Loop Brandon in once Ben's answers land", "description": "Notify Brandon when Ben's responses on the outstanding questions are ready and keep both parties in the loop.", "assignee_name": "<the person responsible for chasing Ben>", "confidence": 0.6 }
- Bad: "Brandon Clymer asked Joe Metz to send an updated CAD drawing that shows trays."
  Good: { "title": "Send updated CAD with trays to Brandon", "description": "Produce and send an updated CAD drawing showing the tray layout to Brandon Clymer.", "assignee_name": "Joe Metz", "assigned_by": "Brandon Clymer", "confidence": 0.95 }
