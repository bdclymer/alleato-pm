"""Canonical Acumatica cost-line gross-value resolution.

Single owner of the "gross extended line value" ladder that was previously
forked across three writers in ``acumatica_sync.py`` (the AP-bill direct-cost
projection and the subcontract / purchase-order SOV projections) plus a JS
backfill port. In Acumatica, ``ExtendedCost`` (alias ``ExtCost``) is the GROSS
extended line value; ``Amount`` is net of retainage. Retainage is applied at
invoicing, never baked into cost values — using ``Amount`` understates every
retained line (the 2026-07 direct-cost bug, PR #878).

The three copies had drifted on four independent axes: whether they unwrap
Acumatica ``{"value": x}`` envelopes, whether they honor the ``ExtCost`` alias,
and two different zero/None selection styles. This module reproduces each
caller's exact current behavior through explicit flags, so the previously
hidden divergences are now visible at each call site:

    purchase-order SOV : resolve_gross_extended(detail, treat_zero_as_missing=True)
    subcontract SOV    : resolve_gross_extended(detail, use_first_present_raw=True)
    AP direct cost     : resolve_gross_extended(detail, unwrap=False, include_ext_cost=False)

The AP flags (``unwrap=False, include_ext_cost=False``) are the buggy legacy
path: an AP detail carrying ``ExtCost`` (not ``ExtendedCost``) or a wrapped
value silently falls through to the net ``Amount``. That divergence is fixed in
an isolated, reconciled follow-up by dropping those two flags.

      purchase-order writer's ``_num(...) or _num(...)`` truthiness chain).

      after unwrapping, then coerce to float once (the subcontract writer's
      ``raw = a if a is not None else b`` style), instead of the first field that
