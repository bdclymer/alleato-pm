# Budget Line Items

A budget line item is one row in the budget tied to a cost code and cost type. Line items are the base unit for tracking budget vs actual on the project.

## Add a Line Item

1. Open **Budget** for the project.
2. Select **Add Line Item**.
3. Choose the **Cost Code** from the project cost code list.
4. Choose the **Cost Type** (labor, material, equipment, subcontract, other).
5. Enter the **Description** and **Original Budget** amount.
6. Save the line item.

If the cost code does not appear, ask an admin to add it to the project cost code list first.

## Edit a Line Item

1. Click the line item row.
2. Update the description, quantity, unit cost, or original budget.
3. Save changes.

Direct edits to original budget should be rare after contract signing. Use a budget modification when the change should be tracked.

## Apply a Budget Modification

A budget modification moves money between line items without changing the contract value.

1. Open the line item or use the **Modifications** action.
2. Enter source and target line items.
3. Enter the amount and a reason.
4. Submit for approval if your project requires it.

## Forecast

The forecast column projects total cost at completion. It can be:

- **Auto-calculated** based on actual + remaining committed.
- **Manually overridden** when the project manager has better information.

Switch a line item's forecast method from the line item detail panel.
