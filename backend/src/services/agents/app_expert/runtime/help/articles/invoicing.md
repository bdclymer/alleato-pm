# Invoicing

The Invoicing tool handles two flows: owner pay applications (billing the owner) and subcontractor invoices (subs billing the project). Both bill against an approved schedule of values.

## Open Invoicing

1. Select the project.
2. Open **Invoicing** from the sidebar.
3. Use the tabs to switch between **Owner Invoices** and **Subcontractor Invoices**.

## Owner Pay Applications

Owner invoices are pay applications submitted to the owner against the prime contract SOV.

1. Select **Create Owner Invoice**.
2. Choose the **Billing Period**.
3. Enter the **% Complete** or **Amount Billed** for each prime contract SOV line.
4. Apply retainage as configured on the prime contract.
5. Review the cover sheet and totals.
6. Submit for approval, then send to the owner.

## Subcontractor Invoices

Subcontractor invoices bill the project against a commitment SOV.

1. Select **Create Subcontractor Invoice**.
2. Choose the **Commitment**.
3. Enter the billed amount or % complete for each SOV line.
4. Apply retainage and any deductions.
5. Attach the subcontractor's invoice PDF and any lien waivers.
6. Submit for approval.

## Status

- **Draft** — in progress, not yet submitted.
- **Submitted** — awaiting review.
- **Approved** — approved for payment.
- **Paid** — payment recorded.
- **Rejected** — returned for revision.

## Approve an Invoice

Approval requires the **approve_invoices** capability. See [Manage User Access](/docs/manage-permissions).

1. Open the invoice record.
2. Review SOV lines, retainage, and attachments.
3. Select **Approve** or **Reject** with comments.

## Subcontractor Submission Portal

Subcontractors can submit their own invoices through the portal. See [Submit an Invoice](/docs/submit-invoice).
