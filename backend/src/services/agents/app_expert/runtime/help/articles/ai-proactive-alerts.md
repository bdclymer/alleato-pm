# Proactive AI Alerts

The platform runs a daily check across all active projects and automatically creates insight cards for issues that cross defined thresholds. You do not need to set up alerts or monitors — the system flags problems for you.

## What Gets Flagged

### Budget Variance

Triggered when a project's forecast exceeds the revised budget by more than 10%.

The alert includes the project name, the current variance amount, and the percentage over budget.

### Overdue RFIs

Triggered when an open RFI has passed its due date.

The alert includes the RFI number, subject, the number of days past due, and who the ball is currently in court with.

### Late Schedule Tasks

Triggered when an incomplete task has passed its finish date. Milestone tasks marked as critical are flagged immediately with no grace period.

### Stale Change Events

Triggered when an unresolved change event has been open for more than 7 days. Events open for more than 30 days are flagged as critical.

## Where to See Alerts

Alerts appear as insight cards in **Project Intelligence**:

1. Select the project.
2. Open **Intelligence** from the sidebar.
3. Alerts show under the **Risk** and **Financial Exposure** insight card types with the date they were created and the evidence behind them.

The AI assistant also surfaces active alerts when you ask for a project update. Ask "What do I need to know about Vermillion Rise today?" and it will include any flagged alerts in the response.

## Deduplication

The system avoids creating duplicate alerts. If the same issue was already flagged today, it is not reflagged until the original alert is resolved or a new day begins.

## Resolving an Alert

Mark an alert resolved from the Project Intelligence page once the underlying issue has been addressed. Resolved alerts are archived and no longer surface in the active view.
