"""Synthesized project & portfolio intelligence tools.

These read the **deep-read synthesis** — `intelligence_packets` (the rolling
per-target executive state written by the intelligence compiler /
`project_synthesizer.py`) and `insight_cards` — instead of re-deriving status
from raw rows.

This is the authoritative narrative source for "what's going on", "what are the
risks / issues", "status", and "brief me" questions. The synthesis already
weighed meetings, emails, Teams, RFIs, submittals, budget, and change activity
into a strategic read. Prefer these tools over `project_risk_snapshot` /
`recent_activity` / `portfolio_overview`, which are raw-data fallbacks used only
when no fresh packet exists or the user asks for a specific number.

Tables live in the PM APP database (`lgveqfnpkxvzbnnwuled`):
- `intelligence_targets`  — one row per project/initiative/process. `project_id`
  maps a `client_project` target to `projects.id`.
- `intelligence_packets`  — synthesized state per target. `packet_type='current'`
  is the live rolling brief; `target_id` -> `intelligence_targets.id`.
- `insight_cards`         — discrete evidence-backed findings; `primary_target_id`
  -> `intelligence_targets.id`.
