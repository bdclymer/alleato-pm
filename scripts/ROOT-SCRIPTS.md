# Root Scripts Inventory

Status: Active inventory
Owner: Ops/dev tooling
Last updated: 2026-06-22

Root-level files under `scripts/` are legacy entry points. New scripts should go
under an owner folder (`scripts/verify/`, `scripts/ops/`, `scripts/db/`,
`scripts/ingestion/`, etc.) unless there is a specific reason to keep a root
entry point.

Status meanings:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `package-owned` | Called by root `package.json`; live until package script changes. |
| `live-guardrail` | Used as a guard/check, even if not currently package-owned. |
| `live-operator` | Manual operational script that may still be useful. |
| `migration-helper` | Database or storage migration helper; inspect before reuse. |
| `backfill-helper` | One-off/backfill helper; do not run without fresh owner review. |
| `import-helper` | Historical import helper; candidate for archive after reference check. |
| `test-helper` | Old ad hoc test/check script; candidate to move under tests/verify. |
| `reference` | Data/config/reference, not executable runtime. |
| `config` | Tool config. |

## Deletion Policy

Do not add more root-level scripts by default. For new tooling:

1. Put it in the owning folder.
2. Add or update a package script if it is meant to be a supported command.
3. Update this inventory only if a root-level entry point is unavoidable.

Candidates for future archive/delete passes are `backfill-helper`,
`import-helper`, and `test-helper` entries that are not referenced by package
scripts, docs, current task ledgers, or active provider recovery runbooks.

Deleted unsafe/stale migration helpers:

- `apply-budget-migration.mjs`
- `apply-migration-pg.js`
- `apply-migration.js`
- `apply-permissions-fix.js`
- `apply-permissions-fix.mjs`
- `apply-storage-rls-migration.sh`
- `create-drawing-tables.js`
- `fix-mcp-and-create-tables.js`

## Deleted Root Helpers

One-off root helpers (backfills, imports, ad-hoc tests) were **deleted** on
2026-06-23 — git history is the archive. Recover any of them with
`git log --all --diff-filter=D -- scripts/archive/2026-06-22-root-helpers/`.
A pre-commit guard now blocks re-introducing `archive/` folders or
`.bak/.old/.orig` files under `scripts/` and `backend/`.
