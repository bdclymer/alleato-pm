/**
 * API Smoke Test Suite — runs against the live production URL.
 *
 * Strategy:
 * - Health endpoint must return 200 with correct shape
 * - Protected endpoints must return 200 or 401 (never 500 or timeout)
 * - 500 = server bug, always a failure regardless of auth
 * - 401/403 = expected for protected routes, counts as pass
 * - 000 = timeout/unreachable, always a failure
 *
 * Run locally:
 *   API_SMOKE_BASE_URL=https://projects.alleatogroup.com node scripts/api-smoke-contracts.mjs
 *
 * Run in CI:
 *   Triggered by GitHub Actions cron (daily at 8am UTC)

// silent 200. This contract asserts:
//   - HTTP 200 (a healthy query must NOT 500)
