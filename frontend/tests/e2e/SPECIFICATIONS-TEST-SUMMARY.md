## Test Distribution

### Original Test Suite (`specifications.spec.ts`)

| # | Test Name | Category | Coverage |
|---|-----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Upload new specification | CRUD | Create operation with PDF upload |
| 2 | Filter by search | Search | Search by section number/title |
| 3 | Filter by status | Filter | Active/Archived filtering |
| 4 | View detail page | CRUD | Read operation, navigation |
| 5 | Add revision | Revisions | Create new revision |
| 6 | Edit metadata | CRUD | Update title/description |
| 7 | Delete specification | CRUD | Delete with confirmation |
| 8 | Validate required fields | Validation | Form validation |

### Extended Test Suite (`specifications-extended.spec.ts`)

#### File Upload Validation Tests (4)

| # | Test Name | Validates |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 9 | Reject non-PDF files (.docx) | File type restriction (application/vnd.openxmlformats) |
| 10 | Reject non-PDF files (.txt) | File type restriction (text/plain) |
| 11 | Reject oversized files (>50MB) | File size limit enforcement |
| 12 | Accept valid PDF | Successful upload within limits |

**Why These Matter:**

- Prevents storage waste from invalid uploads
- Protects against denial-of-service via large files
- Ensures consistent file handling across the system

#### Revision Management Tests (6)

| # | Test Name | Validates |
|---|-----------|-----------|

| 14 | Set current revision | Current revision indicator display |
| 15 | Download revision | File download functionality |
| 16 | Delete non-current revision | Cleanup old revisions |
| 17 | Prevent delete current revision | Protect active revision |
| 18 | Add revision with notes | Revision metadata tracking |

**Why These Matter:**

- Maintains document history audit trail
- Prevents accidental deletion of active documents
- Enables tracking of specification changes over time

#### Area Management Tests (3)

| # | Test Name | Validates |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 19 | Assign specification to area | Area assignment functionality |
| 20 | Filter by area | Area-based filtering |
| 21 | Multi-area assignment | Specs can belong to multiple areas |

**Why These Matter:**

- Organizes specs by building areas/zones

|---|-----------|-----------|
| 22 | Pagination controls | UI shows pagination when >20 items |
| 23 | Navigate between pages | Page navigation works correctly |
| 24 | Search with no results | Empty state display |
| 25 | Case-insensitive search | Search works regardless of case |

**Why These Matter:**

- Ensures usability with large spec libraries (100+ specs)
- Validates search functionality for quick spec lookup
- Tests edge case of no search results

#### Edge Cases Tests (6)

| # | Test Name | Validates |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 26 | Prevent duplicate section numbers | Unique constraint enforcement |
| 27 | Special characters in title | HTML escaping, XSS prevention |
| 28 | Empty description | Optional fields work correctly |
| 29 | Long section numbers | Extended numbering schemes (99 77 03 04 05...) |
| 30 | Very long titles | Title length limits or truncation |
| 31 | Error recovery | Cancel dialogs, dismiss toasts |

**Why These Matter:**

- Prevents data integrity issues (duplicates)
- Validates security (XSS via special chars)
- Tests real-world data variations

## Test Data Strategy

### Fixtures Used

```text
frontend/tests/fixtures/
├── test-document.pdf         (455 bytes - valid PDF)
├── revised-drawing.pdf        (324 bytes - valid PDF)
├── test-drawing-1.pdf         (324 bytes - valid PDF)
├── test-drawing-2.pdf         (324 bytes - valid PDF)
└── invalid-file.txt           (32 bytes - non-PDF)
```markdown
### Generated Test Data

- **Large PDFs**: Generated in-memory (52MB) for size validation
- **Bulk Specs**: 35 specs created for pagination tests
- **Section Numbers**: Use `99 XX XX` range to avoid conflicts
- **Test Areas**: Created/cleaned up per test suite

### Cleanup Strategy

```typescript
test.beforeAll()  → Create test data (specs, areas, revisions)
test.afterAll()   → Delete test data by ID
test.afterEach()  → Cleanup per-test resources
```markdown
**Cleanup guarantees:**
- No test data left behind
- Tests can run multiple times
- Tests are isolated (no interdependencies)

## Performance Metrics

### Execution Time

| Test File | Test Count | Avg Duration | Max Duration |
|-----------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| specifications.spec.ts | 8 | 45-60s | ~60s |
| specifications-extended.spec.ts | 18 | 90-120s | ~120s |
| **Total** | **26** | **135-180s** | **~3 min** |

### Resource Usage

- **Database Queries**: ~150-200 (create, read, delete)
- **File Uploads**: ~30-40 (including large file test)
- **Page Navigations**: ~50-60
- **API Calls**: ~100-150

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Multi-area assignment** - UI may not fully support multiple areas yet
2. **Revision "set as current"** - Feature may need implementation
3. **File size validation** - Backend enforcement needed
4. **Download content verification** - Only checks download initiation
5. **RLS policies** - Tests run with service role, not real auth user

### Future Test Additions

- [ ] Test concurrent uploads (race conditions)
- [ ] Test spec permissions by role (viewer vs editor)
- [ ] Test revision diffs (compare two revisions)
- [ ] Test spec export (PDF package generation)
- [ ] Test spec sharing (email, link sharing)
- [ ] Test spec comments/annotations
- [ ] Test spec approval workflows
- [ ] Performance tests (1000+ specs)
- [ ] Mobile responsive tests
- [ ] Accessibility tests (WCAG compliance)
