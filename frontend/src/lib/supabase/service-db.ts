 * Service data router — the one module that owns "for this table, which Supabase
 * project, which service-role client, and which generated-types generic?".
 *
 * Use `serviceDb.from(table)` instead of picking `createServiceClient()` (PM APP)
 * vs `createRagServiceClient()` (AI Database) by hand. The router selects the
 * client AND calls `.from()` itself, returning the native Supabase query builder
 * already bound to the right project — so the table you route on IS the table you
 * query, and querying the wrong project is unrepresentable. The same map drives
 * the return type, so a builder can no longer be typed for the wrong project.
 *
 * Scope: the **service-role** surface only. The AI Database is reached exclusively
 * via service-role (there is no anon/cookie RAG client), so RLS cookie/browser
 * paths are always PM APP, already correct, and are NOT routed here — keep using
 * `@/lib/supabase/server` and `@/lib/supabase/client` for those.
 *
 * See CONTEXT.md → "Data access / Supabase project routing".
