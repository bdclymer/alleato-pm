/**
 * Autonomous triage of stuck AI learning candidates.
 *
 * The learning loop creates `agent_learnings` rows. Categorized feedback (a
 * thumbs-down with a reason, a submittal-review correction) lands as `active`
 * immediately, but an uncategorized thumbs-down lands as `candidate` and only
 * activates on a *second* occurrence — so single-occurrence candidates pile up
 * forever and never influence the AI (51 stuck as of 2026-06-27).
 *
 * This module scores each candidate with a cheap model and takes ONE of three
 * actions, behind deliberate safety rails:
 *   - promote  → status `active` (only on a confident, specific verdict)
 *   - archive  → status `archived` (only on a confident junk verdict)
 *   - keep     → left as `candidate` for human review
 *
 * Safety: feature-flagged off by default, conservative thresholds, every action
 * is a reversible status flip (no deletes), and the full run is reported to
 * Teams. It deliberately does NOT auto-apply the human-review
 * `ai_learning_promotions` queue — that gate stays human. It only counts that
 * queue for the digest.
