/**
 * Code-owned LLM-as-a-judge for assistant responses.
 *
 * Scores the semantic quality the cheap heuristics in `score-response-quality.ts`
 * can't see — directly targeting the failure modes this assistant actually hit:
 * deflection (answering a different thing / a system-status report instead of the
 * question) and generic filler. Runs on a SAMPLE of production responses and
 * writes the result as Langfuse trace scores.
 *
 * OFF BY DEFAULT — set LANGFUSE_LLM_JUDGE_ENABLED=true and a non-zero
 * LANGFUSE_LLM_JUDGE_SAMPLE_RATE to turn it on. This keeps a real (small) LLM
 * cost from appearing until you opt in.
 *
 * Cost knobs:
 *   LANGFUSE_LLM_JUDGE_ENABLED      "true" to enable (default off)
 *   LANGFUSE_LLM_JUDGE_SAMPLE_RATE  0..1, fraction of responses judged (default 0)
 *   LANGFUSE_LLM_JUDGE_MODEL        model id (default "gpt-4.1-mini")
