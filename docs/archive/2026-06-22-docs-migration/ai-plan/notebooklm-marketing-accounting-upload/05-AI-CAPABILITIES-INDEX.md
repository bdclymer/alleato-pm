## The C-Suite Advisors

Every question goes through the **Chief Strategist**, which routes to the right specialist. For cross-domain questions, the Strategist consults multiple advisors and synthesizes the answer.

| Advisor | Domain | Sample Questions |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **CFO** | Finances, margin, cash, ERP | "What's our cash position?" / "Where are we losing margin?" |
| **COO** | Field ops, schedule, daily logs | "What tasks are running late on Vermillion Rise?" |
| **CRO** | Risk, exposure, overdue items | "What are our top risks across all projects?" |
| **CHRO** | Team, staffing, capacity | "Who is over-allocated next month?" |
| **VP Business Development** | Pipeline, market intel, web search | "Research tilt-up warehouse costs in our market." |

The VP BD advisor can search the web in real time — the others work from your project data.

## What the AI Can See

| Data Source | Examples |
|-------------|---------|
| **Project financials** | Budgets, commitments, change orders, direct costs, invoices, prime contracts |
| **Project records** | RFIs, submittals, daily logs, punch lists, schedule tasks, drawings |
| **Meetings** | Fireflies transcripts, extracted decisions, action items, risks |
| **Emails** | Indexed Outlook emails, matched to projects |
| **Teams messages** | Compiled channel posts and DMs |
| **Accounting (Acumatica)** | AP/AR aging, cash position, vendor spend, bills, POs |
| **Documents** | PDFs, Word docs, specs, and OneDrive files (indexed content) |
| **Company knowledge** | Saved lessons, standard practices, and preferences from the knowledge base |
| **Your memory** | Preferences and context saved across your past conversations |

---

## What the AI Cannot Do

- **Approve, sign, or pay** on your behalf — all financial writes require your confirmation
- **Access records outside your permissions** — the AI is scoped to projects you can edit
- **See unsynced data** — emails and Teams messages only appear after the integration syncs (every 30 minutes)
- **Guarantee accuracy on high-stakes decisions** — always verify financial and schedule data against source records before acting
- **Access competitor systems** — it only reads the platforms connected to your account
