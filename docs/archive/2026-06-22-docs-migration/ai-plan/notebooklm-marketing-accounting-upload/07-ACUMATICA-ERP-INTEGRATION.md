# Acumatica ERP Integration

Alleato OS connects to Acumatica to read live accounting data: accounts payable aging, accounts receivable aging, cash position, vendor balances, and project budgets recorded in the ERP.

## What It Powers

- **CFO advisor** — the AI assistant can answer questions about cash, AR aging, and AP aging using live ERP data.
- **Budget reconciliation** — compare project budgets in Alleato to budgets recorded in Acumatica.
- **Invoice status** — check whether invoices marked Approved in Alleato have been recorded in the ERP.

## How It Works

- The integration calls Acumatica's REST API on demand.
- Data is read-only: Alleato does not write back to Acumatica.
- Authentication uses a dedicated service account configured by an admin.

## Common Questions to Ask

Once connected, ask the [AI Assistant](/docs/ai-assistant-overview):

- "What is our current cash position?"
- "Show AR aging over 60 days."
- "Which vendors have the largest open AP?"
- "What is the ERP-recorded budget for Vermillion Rise?"

## Configuration

The Acumatica integration is configured by your admin. Individual users do not need to authenticate separately.
