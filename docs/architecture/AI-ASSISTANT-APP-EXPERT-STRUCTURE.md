# AI Assistant App Expert Structure

**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Status:** Initial implementation added
**Scope:** Alleato AI assistant subagents, skills, and tools needed for accurate questions about the web application itself.

## Purpose

The AI assistant needs a dedicated way to answer questions about the Alleato PM web application: where features live, how workflows behave, which permissions apply, what data backs a page, what actions the assistant can perform, and what is currently implemented versus planned.

The recommended structure is not to keep adding more general tools to the main strategist. The main strategist should route. A dedicated App Expert subagent should answer application-knowledge questions using validated documentation, generated inventories, and read-only lookup tools.

## Recommended Routing Model

| Layer | Responsibility | Status | Why it belongs here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main strategist / orchestrator | Classify the user request, preserve conversation context, enforce user/project scope, and delegate to the correct specialist. | Implemented, needs App Expert route | Keeps the main assistant from becoming an unstructured tool pile. |
| App Expert subagent | Answer questions about the web app itself: features, routes, workflows, permissions, UI behavior, data backing, known limitations, and troubleshooting. | Implemented as backend endpoint and wired into `app_help` chat retrieval | App knowledge has different evidence rules than project/business synthesis. |
| Module skills | Load detailed module-specific playbooks only when relevant. | Initial navigation, feature-status, and permissions skills implemented | Prevents the App Expert prompt from becoming too large while preserving depth. |
| Read-only app knowledge tools | Retrieve current sitemap, feature registry, help articles, route inventory, source map, API contracts, schema, and code pointers. | Initial generated sitemap and feature-registry tools implemented | Accuracy depends on generated and validated source-of-truth artifacts, not memory alone. |
| Evals and freshness checks | Verify that app-help answers remain correct as routes, tools, and docs change. | Implemented initial 50-case strict eval suite; needs CI/prod gate | Prevents the assistant from confidently explaining stale UI behavior. |

## Subagent Table

| Subagent | Status | What it does | How the orchestrator knows to use it | Description the agent receives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `strategist` | Implemented | Primary assistant persona. Synthesizes answers, routes to specialists, and handles natural conversation. | Default entry point for `/ai-assistant`; handles broad questions unless a narrower route is detected. | "You are Alleato's chief strategist. Answer with a point of view, evidence, and a recommended next action. Delegate to specialists when a narrower expert can answer more accurately." |
| `financial-analyst` | Implemented in backend Deep Agents; related CFO specialist exists in frontend | Investigates budgets, commitments, change orders, pay applications, margin, cash, and Acumatica financial data. | Financial intent: budget, cost, margin, cash, AP/AR, commitments, invoices, pay apps, change-order exposure. | "Delegate financial questions: budget vs. actuals, commitments, change orders, pay applications, cash position, Acumatica data. Give one focused question at a time." |
| `schedule-analyst` | Implemented in backend Deep Agents | Investigates milestones, schedule health, delays, float, baseline variance, and recent schedule-related communications. | Schedule intent: delay, milestone, critical path, slippage, schedule risk, dates, lookahead. | "Delegate schedule questions: status vs. baseline, float, critical path, milestones, delays. Give one focused question at a time." |
| `risk-analyst` | Implemented in backend Deep Agents; related CRO specialist exists in frontend | Surfaces project, financial, contractual, communication, and operational risk. | Risk intent: red flags, exposure, overdue items, unanswered RFIs/submittals, claim signals, recurring issues. | "Delegate risk-surfacing: aged RFIs, late submittals, unanswered communications, approaching deadlines, contractual exposure. Give one focused question at a time." |
| `communications-analyst` | Implemented in backend Deep Agents | Reviews meeting transcripts, Teams messages, emails, stakeholder tone, sentiment, and communication history. | Communication-source intent: "who said", "what did we decide", emails, Teams, meetings, client tone, unanswered messages. | "Delegate stakeholder-communication investigation: meeting discussions, Teams threads, email tone, sentiment. Give one focused question at a time." |
| `business-development-analyst` | Implemented in backend Deep Agents | Investigates pipeline, pursuits, estimating handoffs, client relationship risk, proposals, and stuck deals. | Business-development intent: pursuit, client follow-up, estimate, proposal, quote, lead, deal, relationship risk. | "Delegate pipeline and client-development questions: pursuits, estimating handoffs, proposal or quote follow-up, client relationship risk, and stuck deals. Give one focused question at a time." |
| `microsoft-executive-assistant` | Implemented as dedicated backend service, production-gated | Handles Microsoft-native inbox, calendar, Teams, and drafting workflows where live Microsoft data matters more than RAG. | Microsoft operator intent: today's emails, inbox triage, calendar, draft reply, Teams send, live mailbox state. | "Use live Microsoft sources for inbox, calendar, Teams, and drafting tasks. Prefer direct source reads over stale synced approximations. Require approval for sends or sensitive write actions." |
| `research-agent` | Implemented as backend Deep Agent | Combines public web research with internal Alleato project/RAG context. | External research intent: public web, market, company research, trend, third-party source verification. | "Research public web and Alleato internal context separately, cite sources, and distinguish public evidence from internal project evidence." |
| `content-builder` | Implemented as backend Deep Agent | Produces marketing/content artifacts with optional research and images. | Content creation intent: blog, LinkedIn, X thread, campaign asset, marketing content package. | "Create requested content artifacts in the workspace, use research when needed, and return artifact paths and concise production notes." |
| `app-expert` | Implemented as `/api/intelligence/app-expert` and wired into `app_help` retrieval | Answers questions about the Alleato web app itself: routes, features, permissions, workflows, UI behavior, data model, assistant actions, known gaps, and troubleshooting. | App-help or app-knowledge intent: "where do I", "how does this page work", "what does this button do", "what table powers this", "is this implemented", "what can the assistant do", "why can't I see". | "You are the Alleato PM application expert. Answer from curated app docs first, generated sitemap and feature registry second, source/schema/code lookup third. Include exact routes or source references. If evidence conflicts or is missing, say what was checked and what remains uncertain." |
| `app-diagnostics` | Recommended later | Investigates "this page looks broken" or "why is this feature not working" with route, console, API, permission, and source-health evidence. | Runtime troubleshooting intent: broken page, missing data, 404/500, empty dropdown, hidden button, permission surprise. | "Diagnose application behavior from route metadata, user role, source health, API contracts, logs, and browser evidence. Report cause, detection gap, and prevention step." |
| `implementation-planner` | Recommended later | Converts accepted feature requests or app gaps into implementation plans, Linear issues, and Codex handoffs. | Build-planning intent: "what needs to be built", "create a plan", "turn this into issues", "handoff to Codex". | "Translate product intent into scoped engineering work with owner files, validation steps, risk, and acceptance criteria. Do not perform writes without an explicit approval path." |

## Skill Table

## Required Generated Artifacts

| Artifact | Status | Source inputs | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app-sitemap.generated.json` | Implemented | `frontend/src/app/**`, route groups, nav/sidebar config, page metadata, auth helpers | `getAppSitemap`, `lookupRoute` |
| `feature-registry.generated.json` | Implemented | Help docs, action registry, route inventory, module config, source maps | `searchFeatureRegistry`, `getFeatureDetails` |
| `permissions-matrix.generated.json` | Needs to be built | permission helpers, route guards, RLS docs, admin role config | `lookupPermissionRule` |
| `source-map.generated.json` | Needs to be built | route files, component imports, API handlers, service/hook usage, tests | `lookupComponentMap`, `lookupApiContract`, `lookupTestsForFeature` |
| `known-limitations.generated.json` | Needs to be built | feature flags, TODO inventory, disabled routes/actions, roadmap docs, eval failures | `getKnownLimitations` |
| `app-expert-eval-suite.json` | Implemented with 50 cases | Golden questions and expected evidence requirements | App Expert quality gate |

## Evidence Priority For App Expert Answers

1. Curated app-help docs with `ai_visible: true`.
2. Generated sitemap and feature registry.
3. Generated permission, source-map, data-model, and API-contract artifacts.
4. Current source code lookup.
5. Runtime/browser evidence for troubleshooting questions.

If the evidence conflicts, the App Expert should say what conflicts and avoid presenting uncertain behavior as confirmed.

## Implementation Notes

- Keep App Expert read-only by default.
- Do not expose broad filesystem or SQL access directly to client-facing users.
- Generate structured artifacts from source and validate them in CI or the finish flow.
- Use skills for module depth, not always-loaded prompt bulk.
- Keep existing project/business specialists for business answers; App Expert owns application-behavior answers.
- Add evals before production routing so the assistant cannot pass with vague answers.

## Current Baseline

- Generated artifacts: 283 routes, 290 features, 58 help articles, 51 documented routes.
- Strict App Expert eval: 50/50 passed against production backend on 2026-05-21.
- Production eval artifact: `docs/archive/2026-06-22-docs-migration/ai-plan/evals/runs/2026-05-21T19-18-58-162Z-app-expert/summary.md`.
- Production latency baseline: p50 4.3s, p90 7.9s, max 12.0s.
- Production smoke gate: `npm run rag:verify:app-expert-smoke:prod` checks active backend health, OpenAPI exposure, Render flags, and one grounded App Expert answer.
- Full production quality gate: `npm run rag:verify:app-expert-evals:prod`.
- Production requirement: keep `DEEP_AGENTS_APP_EXPERT_ENABLED=true` and `DEEP_AGENTS_APP_EXPERT_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini` configured on the active Render backend service before relying on production chat routing.

## Definition Of Done

The App Expert is ready when:

1. It can answer app-navigation, feature-status, permission, workflow, and data-source questions with route/source references.
2. It refuses to guess when docs and code disagree.
3. Its generated sitemap and feature registry are checked for freshness.
4. It passes a golden app-help eval suite.
5. User-facing answers distinguish implemented, partially implemented, planned, blocked, and deprecated behavior.
