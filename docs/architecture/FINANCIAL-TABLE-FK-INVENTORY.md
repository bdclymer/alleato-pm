# Financial Table FK Inventory

Last reviewed: 2026-07-06

This document inventories the financial database tables in `alleato-pm`, what
each table controls, and the FK / FX fields that define ownership and rollup
relationships.

Assumption: "FX fields" means foreign-key fields. This inventory uses `FK / FX`
to preserve that wording while documenting actual foreign keys.

## Sources Checked

- `frontend/src/types/database.types.ts` for generated table and FK truth.
- `supabase/migrations/schema_dump.sql` for schema and historical constraint context.
- `frontend/src/components/dev-tools/db-inventory.generated.json` for generated table purpose and usage notes. This inventory was generated at `2026-07-01T22:10:03.769Z`, so row counts and dormant/dead labels should be rechecked before destructive cleanup.
- `docs/architecture/FINANCIAL-TOOLS-DATA-MAP.md` for older financial tool ownership context.

## High-Risk Integrity Findings

| Finding | Impact | Recommended Direction |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| `subcontract_sov_items.budget_code` is text, not a FK. | Subcontract SOV rows can store arbitrary budget-code text and still drive commitment totals, invoice seed data, and budget rollups. | Add `project_budget_code_id` FK, backfill resolvable rows, require FK on new writes, and quarantine unresolved legacy rows. |
| `purchase_order_sov_items.budget_code` has the same text-backed gap. | Purchase order SOV rows have the same integrity risk as subcontract SOV rows. | Use the same FK migration path as subcontract SOV rows. |
| Some financial domains have active and dormant twins. | Product code can accidentally read or write the wrong table, especially around budget changes, SOVs, PCOs, and payments. | Pick one canonical table per workflow, mark old tables read-only/deprecated, then remove unused readers. |
| Some audit tables are trigger-backed while others are hand-written. | History coverage is inconsistent. Invoice and change-event audits can silently miss state changes if route code forgets to write audit rows. | Move critical audit trails to DB triggers or shared service-layer writers. |
| Migration history still references old `public.contracts` FKs, but generated current types do not expose a `contracts` table. | Historical migrations and stale docs can mislead agents into using the wrong contract owner. | Treat `prime_contracts` as the current owner unless live DB/type regeneration proves otherwise. |

## Canonical Budget-Code Ownership

| Concept | Table | Intended Meaning |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Global code dictionary | `cost_codes` | The master list of valid cost codes across the system. |
| Cost type dictionary | `cost_code_types` | Labor/material/subcontract/etc. classification. |
| Project-enabled budget code | `project_budget_codes` | The project-scoped selectable budget code: project + optional sub-job + cost code + cost type. |
| Budget money row | `budget_lines` | The actual project budget amount row, tied to `project_budget_codes.id`. |
| Correct financial reference for new SOV rows | `project_budget_codes.id` | This should be the canonical FK for commitment SOV rows after repair. |

## Reference And Project Budget Controls

| Table | Controls | FK / FX Fields | Notes |
| ----- | -------- | -------------- | ----- |
| `cost_code_divisions` | Cost code division groupings. | No declared FK. | Reference table. |
| `cost_codes` | Global master cost code table. | `division_id -> cost_code_divisions(id)` | Global dictionary, not project-specific activation. |

| `project_budget_settings` | Per-project budget UI/settings configuration. | `project_id -> projects(id)` | Generated inventory says schema/API exist but no saved settings. |
| `budget_views` | Saved budget column-layout state. | `project_id -> projects(id)` | UI state, not financial truth. |
| `budget_view_columns` | Columns for saved budget views. | `view_id -> budget_views(id)` | UI state, not financial truth. |

## Derived Views And Financial Read Models

These are not tables, but they are important read surfaces and can hide source
table confusion.

| View | Controls / Purpose | Base Truth To Verify |
| ---- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `v_budget_lines` | Budget line read model used by several FK joins in generated types. | `budget_lines` plus joined cost/project data. |
| `commitments_unified` | Unified read model for `subcontracts` and `purchase_orders`. | `subcontracts`, `purchase_orders`, and their SOV tables. |
| `subcontracts_with_totals` | Subcontract totals read model. | `subcontracts` plus `subcontract_sov_items`. |
| `purchase_orders_with_totals` | Purchase order totals read model. | `purchase_orders` plus `purchase_order_sov_items`. |
| `prime_contract_financial_summary` | Prime contract summary read model. | `prime_contracts`, contract line items, owner invoices/payments, and change orders. |
| `cost_by_category` | Cost category reporting view. | Verify against direct costs, commitments, and budget rollups before use. |
| `cost_codes_with_division_title` | Cost-code display view with division title. | `cost_codes` and `cost_code_divisions`. |
| `direct_costs_with_project` | Direct cost read model with project context. | `direct_costs`. |
| `sov_line_items_with_percentage` | Generic SOV line display view. | `sov_line_items`; likely part of dead generic SOV family. |

## Immediate Repair Priority

| Priority | Work | Reason |
| -------- | ---- | ------ |
| P0 | Add canonical `project_budget_code_id` to `subcontract_sov_items` and `purchase_order_sov_items`. | These are core financial rows and currently bypass the canonical project budget-code key. |
| P0 | Require canonical budget-code FK on all new commitment SOV writes. | Stops new bad data before legacy cleanup finishes. |
| P1 | Backfill resolvable SOV rows and produce an unresolved-row ledger. | Makes legacy ambiguity explicit instead of silently normalized. |
| P1 | Update budget rollups, invoice seeding, PDF/export, and scope lookup to prefer the FK. | Removes dependency on text normalization. |
| P2 | Decide owners for dormant/dead twins: `budget_changes`, `budget_modification_lines`, `schedule_of_values`, `prime_contract_sovs`, `change_orders`, old PCO tables, and payment twins. | Reduces the chance that future code writes to the wrong table. |
