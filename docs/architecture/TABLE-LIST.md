# Database Tables — Live List

> **AUTO-GENERATED — DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.**
> Regenerate with `npm run db:inventory`. Source: `docs/architecture/tables.yaml` + live Supabase stats.
> Last generated: 2026-06-27T12:01:45.966Z

This file lists every table in both Supabase projects with its current status, row count, code-reference count, one-line purpose, and any gotchas/notes. It is the fastest way to answer "does table X exist, what does it do, is it live, does anything use it?"

Column meanings:
- **Rows** — approximate row count from `pg_class.reltuples` (refreshed each regenerate).
- **Code refs** — count of `.from("table")` / `.table("table")` references in `frontend/src`, `backend/src`, and `alleato-ai`. Does NOT include migration files or one-off scripts. **0 code refs + 0 rows = strong drop candidate.** **0 code refs + N rows = stale data, no readers.**
- **Notes** — uses notesForAi when set, otherwise gotchas, from tables.yaml.

For richer information (full writer/reader file lists, columns, line numbers), open the admin UI at `/database-inventory` or read the source: `docs/architecture/tables.yaml`. For architectural narrative + dated corrections, read `docs/architecture/TABLE-INVENTORY.md`.

**How to update:** edit `docs/architecture/tables.yaml` and run `npm run db:inventory`. This file is regenerated from that source.
