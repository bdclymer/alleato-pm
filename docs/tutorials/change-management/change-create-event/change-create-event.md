## Before You Start

- Use the captured Alleato change-event form as the source of truth for the
  step order and visible fields.
- Confirm the change event is complete enough for pricing review before saving
  it in Open status.
- Attach only supporting records that help explain scope, cost, or schedule
  impact for this change.

## Steps

### Step 1: Open the new change event form

Select the project, open Change Events from the sidebar, and start a new change
event to open the Create Change Event form.

Expected result: The Create Change Event form opens.

### Step 2: Fill in the general information

Under General Information, leave Number to auto-generate or set it manually,
then enter a Title and Description that clearly identify the change. Set the
Type, Change Reason, and Scope.

Expected result: The change event is identified with a title, description,
type, reason, and scope.

### Step 3: Set the origin

Choose the Origin and, if applicable, the Origin Record to tie the change event
back to its source.

Expected result: The change event records where the change originated.

### Step 4: Set revenue handling

Set Expecting Revenue and, when revenue is expected, the Line Item Revenue
Source. If you are using markup, set the Prime Contract so markup is calculated
against the correct contract.

Expected result: Revenue handling and markup basis are configured for the line
items.

### Step 5: Add cost line items

In the Line Items section, add a row for each change. Select the Budget Code,
enter a Description, and enter the quantity and unit cost. Add revenue values
where they apply.

Expected result: Each line item has a budget code and pricing, and the total
estimated value rolls up to the change event header.

### Step 6: Attach supporting documents

In the Attachments section, upload supporting files such as drawings, RFIs, or
photos.

Expected result: Supporting documents are attached to the change event.

### Step 7: Save the change event

Select Create Change Event to save. The change event is created in Open status,
ready for pricing review and approval.

Expected result: The completed draft is ready to save without creating demo
data.

## Quality Check

- Confirm the final state in the app matches the expected result for each step.
- Remove any environment-specific or seeded-data references before publishing.

## Common Issues

- If the form redirects to login or access denied, refresh the authenticated
  browser state before rerunning the workflow capture.
- If the line item totals do not roll up correctly, verify the budget code,
  quantity, and unit cost values on each added row before saving.
