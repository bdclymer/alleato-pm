# AI Assistant Final Architecture Verification

Date: 2026-06-26
Linear: AAI-698
Parent: AAI-636
Status: Complete

## Objective

Verify every active AI assistant/tool uses the finalized prompt, tool-calling, and RAG architecture, and repair any confirmed active gaps.

## Scope

- Live `/api/ai-assistant/chat` stream path.
- Assistant prompt architecture and prompt contract evidence.
- AI SDK `streamText` tool-calling path, including MCP discovery/merge/trace/close behavior.
- Finalized RAG retrieval usage and expected-context retrieval proof.
- Microsoft Executive Assistant health path.
- Any active assistant/tool path identified by existing architecture/readiness verifiers.

## Done Checklist

- [x] Create Linear issue before implementation.
- [x] Create task markdown before implementation.
- [x] Post Linear kickoff comment.
- [x] Inventory active assistant prompt, tool, and RAG code paths.
- [x] Run assistant architecture/readiness baseline verifiers and record output.
- [x] Verify live chat architecture uses finalized AI SDK tool calling and MCP lifecycle.
- [x] Verify every active assistant uses finalized RAG retrieval or explicitly documented non-RAG behavior.
- [x] Verify assistants retrieve expected context end to end.
- [x] Classify any failures by owner file and whether they are active production gaps or stale docs/test expectations.
- [x] Patch confirmed active gaps with focused tests or verifier guardrails.
- [x] Delegate frontend typecheck after any TS/JS implementation change.
- [x] Update central AI/RAG finalization `TASKS.md`.
- [x] Update handoff with evidence and residual risk.
- [x] Publish code/docs/evidence if changed.

## Initial Constraints

- The checkout contains unrelated dirty frontend files; this slice must stay scoped to assistant architecture verification, confirmed assistant fixes, task docs, and evidence.
- AI SDK implementation work must follow the local AI SDK skill and current installed docs/source, not memory.
- Full/project typecheck must be delegated to a cheaper verification sub-agent after every TS/JS implementation change.

## Blockers

- Publish is still pending in this working turn.
- The Outlook redrive surfaced a separate production guardrail: `intelligence_extraction` source-signal/task writes are currently blocked by the high-churn AI/intelligence database-write guard. Source sync, embedding, assistant health, project attribution, and source lifecycle recovered and pass; event-driven task/intelligence writes should be tracked as the next cleanup slice before final platform readiness is claimed.

## Root Cause

- Active assistant routing still had model-loop fallthroughs for deterministic workflows:
  - explicit RFI creation prompts did not force preview-only action routing early enough.
  - Teams/source lookup prompts could fall into broad project briefing synthesis instead of direct semantic source retrieval.
  - executive briefing metadata follow-ups such as "When was this regenerated?" asked for a project instead of checking the global `daily_recaps.recap_kind=executive_briefing` row.
  - personal task prompts answered from `public.tasks` but lacked the explicit source marker/citation contract.
  - packet-first project briefings could not resolve project names like "Westfield" when the intelligence-target resolver missed, causing huge model/tool loops and streaming failures.

## Prevention

- Added deterministic, traceable assistant routes for preview-only RFI creation, direct semantic source lookup, executive briefing metadata lookup, personal task source citations, and direct project briefing from loaded project snapshot plus semantic search.
- Added a permission-scoped project-name fallback in retrieval deps so packet-first project briefings resolve from active `projects.name` when intelligence-target resolution misses.
- Preserved/verifier-proved required trace names: `intentPlanner`, `sourceLookupIntentRouter`, `executiveBriefingMetadataLookup`, `getMyTasks`, `serverBusinessContextPreflight`, `getProjectBriefingSnapshot`, and `semanticSearch`.
- Final route verifier now covers all six assistant routing contracts end to end.

## Failure-Loud Guardrail

This slice is not complete until assistant prompt/tool/RAG conformance is proven by repeatable verifiers or any active gaps are repaired with tests and verifier evidence.
