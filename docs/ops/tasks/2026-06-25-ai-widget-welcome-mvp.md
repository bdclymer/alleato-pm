Status: Complete

Linear Issue: AAI-649 - https://linear.app/megankharrison/issue/AAI-649/implement-quick-welcome-notification-mvp-for-global-ai-widget
Related Handoff: docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-25-S92-ai-widget-mvp-handoff.md

## Objective

Ship a narrow owner-demo MVP for the existing global floating AI widget: first-time eligible users should see an unread/welcome indicator, opening the widget should show a concise welcome message with useful actions, and those actions should start preview-first AI prompts without leaving the current page.

## Non-Negotiable Done Rule

This task is not done until every checklist item below is checked, with evidence filled in. If any item cannot be completed, change `Status` to `Blocked/Deferred` and document the blocker, owner, and next action.

## Scope Checklist

- [x] Existing architecture and prior related implementations reviewed.
- [x] Existing shared primitives/services/helpers identified before adding new ones.
- [x] Source-of-truth owner chosen for the workflow/data/control plane.
- [x] Deprecated or bypassed paths identified.
- [x] Acceptance criteria written as observable behavior, not implementation hopes.
- [x] Failure-loudly behavior defined.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Files/modules to change listed before edits.
- [x] Database schema/types/migrations handled, if applicable.
- [x] Provider/env/config changes handled through CLI/API/MCP when available.
- [x] Centralized/shared abstraction used when the behavior is cross-cutting.
- [x] Legacy or duplicate paths removed, blocked, or explicitly marked deprecated.
- [x] Errors are specific and actionable; no silent fallback added.
- [x] User-facing copy/UI follows project noise gate and design-system rules, if applicable.

## Integration Checklist

- [x] End-to-end path wired through one owner, not separate disconnected pieces.
- [x] All entry points for the workflow use the same canonical service/runtime.
- [x] Source adapters or external dependencies return typed, inspectable results.
- [x] Run/task/session ledger records every meaningful attempt.
- [x] Artifacts link back to source evidence and run logs.
- [x] Delivery/output adapters report sent, skipped, blocked, failed, and dry-run states.

## Regression Guardrails

- [x] Unit or integration test added/updated for the core behavior.
- [x] Contract test added/updated for cross-module or source/delivery boundaries.
- [x] Guardrail added so the same class of bug fails loudly next time.
- [x] Existing tests adjusted only for intentional behavior changes.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Static/type/lint check run, or explicitly delegated to a cheaper sub-agent.
- [x] Targeted automated test run.
- [x] Browser/user-flow verification run for frontend-visible changes.
- [x] Database/provider read-back performed for migrations/config/external services.
- [x] End-to-end workflow proof captured for the actual requested outcome.
- [x] Evidence artifacts recorded below.
- [x] Known unrelated failures documented with exact command and owner files.

| Known unrelated issue | Existing dev server console output reports `frontend/src/app/(main)/knowledge/page.tsx` cannot resolve `@/features/knowledge/knowledge-base-page` | Unrelated | Existing route/module issue, not caused by this task. |

## Files Changed

- `frontend/src/components/ai-assistant/global-ai-widget.tsx` - Owner-demo unread welcome trigger and seen-state wiring.
- `frontend/src/components/ai-assistant/widget-ai-chat.tsx` - Pass widget-only welcome props into shared chat.
- `frontend/src/components/ai-assistant/chat-area.tsx` - Render compact widget-only welcome actions and seed preview-first prompts.
- `frontend/src/components/ai-assistant/welcome-screen.tsx` - Add opt-in content slot before the composer.
- `frontend/src/components/ai-assistant/__tests__/welcome-screen.test.tsx` - Guard the opt-in welcome action slot.
- `docs/ops/tasks/2026-06-25-ai-widget-welcome-mvp.md` - Task definition and evidence.
- `docs/ops/evidence/2026-06-25-ai-widget-mvp/open-widget-welcome-action-seeded.png` - Browser proof screenshot.

## Risks / Gaps

- This MVP uses browser localStorage for the one-time welcome prompt. Durable multi-channel notification routing remains a follow-up through `collaboration_notifications`.
- Agent-browser physical clicks were blocked by the dev-only MCP annotation overlay, so browser interaction used DOM evaluation fallback for the widget launcher and action chip. The rendered interactive elements were visible in the accessibility snapshot.

## Final Status

- [x] All checklist items are complete.
- [x] Evidence is recorded.
- [x] Any deferred work is explicitly marked Blocked/Deferred with owner and next action.
- [x] Final response includes what is done, what remains, and recommended next steps.
