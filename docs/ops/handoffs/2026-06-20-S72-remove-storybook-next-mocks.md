7) Commands run and outcome (pass/fail counts):
- PASS: `rg -n "next-link|next-navigation|mocks/next-link|mocks/next-navigation|\\.storybook/mocks/next" ...` found no live references outside S70 audit evidence.
- PASS: `pnpm --dir frontend exec knip --config knip.json --no-exit-code --no-progress --reporter compact | rg '\\.storybook/mocks/(next-link|next-navigation)|next-link|next-navigation' || true` reported both files as unused before deletion.
- PASS: `sed -n '1,160p' frontend/.storybook/main.ts && sed -n '1,180p' frontend/.storybook/preview.tsx` confirmed current Storybook config/preview use `project-context` and `msw-handlers`, not the two Next mocks.
- PASS: `rg -n "from ['\\\"](@/)?App['\\\"]|from ['\\\"]\\.\\/App['\\\"]|<App\\b" ...` found `frontend/src/App.tsx` still imported by `frontend/src/components/layouts/provider-component.tsx`; App was intentionally excluded.
- PASS: `rg -n "next-link|next-navigation|mocks/next-link|mocks/next-navigation|\\.storybook/mocks/next" ...` returned no live references after deletion.
- PASS: `pnpm --dir frontend exec knip --config knip.json --no-exit-code --no-progress --reporter compact | rg '\\.storybook/mocks/(next-link|next-navigation)|next-link|next-navigation' || true` returned no output after deletion.
- PASS: `test ! -e frontend/.storybook/mocks/next-link.tsx && test ! -e frontend/.storybook/mocks/next-navigation.ts`.
- PASS: `npm run check:routes`.
- PASS: `npm run verify:nonprod-routes`.
- PASS: `cd frontend && NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192' TYPECHECK_NO_TIMEOUT=1 npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`.
- PASS: `git diff --check -- ...`.
8) Evidence artifacts (screenshot/video/report/log paths):
- Command output in this Codex run.
9) Top 3 findings (frontend-visible issues first):
- No frontend-visible app change expected because this removes unused Storybook shims.
- The two Storybook Next mock files are not referenced by current Storybook config, preview, stories, scripts, tests, or app code.
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` is a Knip candidate but has a live import and must remain.
10) Recommended next action (one line): Delete only the two Storybook Next mock shims, then rerun focused Knip/search and route guardrails.
11) Handoff file path: docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-20-S72-remove-storybook-next-mocks.md
12) Migration ledger evidence: Not applicable; no database migration.

## Current Status

S72 removed the second S70 deletion batch. Scope stayed limited to two verified
unused Storybook Next mock shims.

## Known Pitfalls

- Do not delete `frontend/src/App.tsx`; it is still imported by
  `frontend/src/components/layouts/provider-component.tsx`.
- Do not stage unrelated local worktree dirt or reference clones.

## Resume Commands

```bash
cd /Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm
git status --short
npm run linear:codex:check -- docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-20-S72-remove-storybook-next-mocks.md
```

## Evidence

- Pre-delete search found no live references to the two Storybook Next mocks.
- Pre-delete Knip reported both files as unused.
- Deleted `frontend/.storybook/mocks/next-link.tsx`.
- Deleted `frontend/.storybook/mocks/next-navigation.ts`.
- Post-delete search found no live references.
- Post-delete Knip no longer reports either file.
- Route, nonprod route, whitespace, and high-heap TypeScript checks passed.
