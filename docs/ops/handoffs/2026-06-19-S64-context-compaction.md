# Handoff: 2026-06-19 - Context Compaction

## Intake Block

1) Session ID: S64
2) Task ID: AAI-562
3) Linear issue: AAI-562
4) Linear URL: https://linear.app/megankharrison/issue/AAI-562/goal-6-context-compaction-for-long-assistant-chats
5) Current status: Published to `origin/main` at `32e73c773`; closeout evidence recorded.

- `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/frontend/src/app/api/ai-assistant/chat/handler-v2.ts`
7) Commands run and outcome (pass/fail counts):
- PASS: AI SDK local docs/source checked for `generateText`, `ModelMessage`, `convertToModelMessages`, and content-part shapes.
- PASS: OpenClaw and Hermes compaction references reviewed.
- PASS: `cd frontend && npm run test:unit -- --runTestsByPath src/lib/ai/stream/__tests__/compaction.test.ts --runInBand`.
- PASS: `cd frontend && npm run quality:changed`.
8) Evidence artifacts (screenshot/video/report/log paths):
- Task evidence: `docs/ops/tasks/2026-06-19-context-compaction.md`.
- Test proof: focused Jest compaction suite, 1 suite / 5 tests.
9) Top 3 findings (frontend-visible issues first):
- No new UI is expected; proof is targeted compaction behavior and handler integration.
- Compaction summary is inserted as a reference-only system message after preserved head context; latest tail remains verbatim.
- Rollout is default-off via `AI_ASSISTANT_CONTEXT_COMPACTION_ENABLED`; thresholds are configurable by env.
10) Recommended next action (one line): Historical closeout recorded; continue with Goal 7 high-risk follow-up planning.
11) Handoff file path: docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-19-S64-context-compaction.md
12) Migration ledger evidence: Not applicable unless implementation discovers a persistence/schema change.

## Linear Updates

- Kickoff comment: df76a135-9791-46fd-946e-1bc2e6d09de8
- Milestone comments: 18e70a01-73ed-4fb8-aede-4c1a902d676e
- Completion/blocker comment: pending.

## Current Status

Goal 6 is published. `frontend/src/lib/ai/stream/compaction.ts` owns threshold checks, reference-only summaries, head/tail retention, previous-summary refresh, historical tool-result pruning, image/file placeholders, and hard-limit failure. `handler-v2.ts` calls the helper after `convertToModelMessages` and before `streamText`, persists compaction metadata on the assistant message, and returns a specific failure message if compaction fails above the hard token limit.

## Known Pitfalls

- Use the AI SDK skill before writing generation/message handling code.
- Do not leave naive truncation and compaction both live without a precedence test.
- Do not summarize system/developer/safety instructions; preserve them verbatim.
- Do not allow compaction summaries to become active user instructions.
- Do not stage unrelated local worktree dirt from the email triage/render changes.
- Broader long-context assistant evals should run before enabling `AI_ASSISTANT_CONTEXT_COMPACTION_ENABLED` in production.

## Resume Commands

```bash
cd /Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm
git status --short
npm run linear:codex:check -- docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-19-S64-context-compaction.md
cd frontend && npm run test:unit -- --runTestsByPath src/lib/ai/stream/__tests__/compaction.test.ts --runInBand
cd frontend && npm run quality:changed
```

## Evidence

- Local AI SDK docs/source verified current `generateText` and `ModelMessage` patterns before implementation.
- OpenClaw/Hermes references reviewed and adapted: threshold gating, head/tail retention, reference-only summaries, tool pruning, binary placeholders, and summary refresh.
- Focused Jest suite passed: under-threshold no-op, over-threshold preservation, summary refresh, bulky tool-result pruning, image/file placeholders, and hard-limit failure.
- Changed-file quality passed.
- Published commit: `32e73c773` (`Add assistant context compaction`).
