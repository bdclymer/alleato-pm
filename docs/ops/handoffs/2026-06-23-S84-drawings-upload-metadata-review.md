7) Commands run and outcome (pass/fail counts): 4 pass
   - PASS: `npm --prefix frontend run test:unit -- --runTestsByPath src/lib/drawings/__tests__/drawing-identity.unit.test.ts src/components/drawings/__tests__/DrawingUploadDialog.partial-failure.test.tsx`.
   - PASS: `cd frontend && npx eslint src/lib/drawings/drawing-identity.ts src/hooks/use-drawing-upload.ts src/components/drawings/DrawingUploadDialog.tsx src/components/drawings/__tests__/DrawingUploadDialog.partial-failure.test.tsx src/lib/drawings/__tests__/drawing-identity.unit.test.ts --no-warn-ignored`.
   - PASS: `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck:changed`.
   - PASS: Browser verification on `http://localhost:3001/1009/drawings` showed selected upload file metadata controls populated from filename before processing.
8) Evidence artifacts (screenshot/video/report/log paths):
   - `tests/agent-browser-runs/2026-06-23-drawings-upload-metadata-review/before-upload-snapshot.txt`
   - `tests/agent-browser-runs/2026-06-23-drawings-upload-metadata-review/upload-empty-snapshot.txt`

   - `tests/agent-browser-runs/2026-06-23-drawings-upload-metadata-review/metadata-review-values.txt`
9) Top 3 findings (frontend-visible issues first):
   - Fixed: Upload dialog now shows filename-detected drawing number, title, revision, and discipline directly on each selected file.
   - Fixed: Users can correct those fields before processing, and both single-file and batch upload paths submit the reviewed values.
   - Fixed: Low-confidence filename parsing is visible as a confidence badge instead of silently guessing.
10) Recommended next action (one line): Continue Drawings parity with true OCR confidence, multi-page PDF splitting, rotation, and delete-from-batch controls.
11) Handoff file path: docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-23-S84-drawings-upload-metadata-review.md
12) Migration ledger evidence: No migration in this slice.

## Linear Updates

- Kickoff comment: covered under AAI-614 continuation.
- Milestone comments:
- Completion/blocker comment: c81531eb-d61a-4105-93ee-6c588bec8da5

## Current Status

Implemented and verified locally. Pending `codex:finish` push to `origin/main`.

## Exact Next Step

Run `npm run linear:codex:check -- docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-23-S84-drawings-upload-metadata-review.md`, post the Linear completion comment, then run `codex:finish` with only the S84-owned files.

## Known Pitfalls

- This is filename-based metadata review, not full PDF OCR confidence. The dialog labels low-confidence detection and lets the user correct it before upload.
- Multi-page PDF splitting, page rotation, and delete-from-batch are still separate upload workflow gaps.
- Do not include unrelated dirty files from other active slices when finishing this task.

## Resume Commands

```bash
npm run linear:codex:check -- docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-23-S84-drawings-upload-metadata-review.md
```

## Evidence

- Targeted Jest - PASS.
- Targeted ESLint - PASS.
- Changed-file typecheck - PASS.
- Browser metadata review proof - PASS.
