7) Commands run and outcome (pass/fail counts): 7 pass, 1 known initial auth failure
   - PASS: Supabase type generation through `.env` with temp-file guard.
   - PASS: Exact migration apply with `psql`.
   - PASS: `npm run db:migrations:verify-applied -- supabase/migrations/20260623155200_drawing_revision_publication_lifecycle.sql`.
   - PASS: Targeted ESLint for changed Drawings services/routes/test.
   - PASS: `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck:changed`.
   - PASS: `npm run test:unit -- --runTestsByPath 'src/app/api/projects/[projectId]/drawings/__tests__/route.test.ts'`.
   - PASS: Browser verification against `http://localhost:3001/1009/drawings`.
   - INITIAL FAIL: Unsourced `npx supabase gen types ...` used the invalid `.env.local` token path and returned `LegacyInvalidAccessTokenError`; `frontend/src/types/database.types.ts` was restored and typegen rerun safely through `.env`.
8) Evidence artifacts (screenshot/video/report/log paths):
   - `tests/agent-browser-runs/2026-06-23-drawings-revision-publish-lifecycle/VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.md`
   - `tests/agent-browser-runs/2026-06-23-drawings-revision-publish-lifecycle/publish-readback.json`
   - `tests/agent-browser-runs/2026-06-23-drawings-revision-publish-lifecycle/final-readback.json`
   - `tests/agent-browser-runs/2026-06-23-drawings-revision-publish-lifecycle/cleanup.json`
   - screenshots in the same folder.
9) Top 3 findings (frontend-visible issues first):
   - Fixed: `drawing_revisions` now has revision publication metadata and `drawings.review_revision_id` separates review-current from published-current.
   - Fixed: default log and review log now read separate views, so published Rev `0` can remain visible while Rev `1` is under review.
   - Fixed: duplicate upload no longer calls unpublish and now only moves the current published pointer when the existing drawing is explicitly unpublished.
10) Recommended next action (one line): Close/push this slice, then build the review queue UI using `drawing_log_review`.
11) Handoff file path: docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-23-S80-drawings-revision-publish-lifecycle.md
12) Migration ledger evidence: `npm run db:migrations:verify-applied -- supabase/migrations/20260623155200_drawing_revision_publication_lifecycle.sql` passed.

## Current Status

Implemented and verified. Not pushed yet.

## Exact Next Step

Run `npm run linear:codex:check -- docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-23-S80-drawings-revision-publish-lifecycle.md`, post Linear update, then close with `codex:finish`.

## Known Pitfalls

- Do not remove `drawings.is_published` in this slice; keep it backward-compatible while revision-level fields become authoritative.
- Do not hide the latest published revision when an under-review revision exists.
- Do not implement the full OCR review queue in this slice.
- During browser verification, an intermediate route guard used `!existing.is_published`; if the selected value was missing/undefined during schema-cache transition, it could move the published pointer. Fixed to `existing.is_published === false`.

## Resume Commands

```bash
npm run linear:codex:check -- docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-23-S80-drawings-revision-publish-lifecycle.md
```

## Evidence

- Supabase type gate via `.env` — PASS.
- Exact migration apply — PASS.
- Migration ledger check — PASS.
- Targeted lint — PASS.
- Changed-file type debt check — PASS.
- Targeted Jest — PASS.
- Browser verification — PASS. `final-readback.json` shows default log Rev `0` published/approved and review log Rev `1` under review/unpublished.
- Cleanup — PASS. Verification drawing soft-deleted and verification set archived.
