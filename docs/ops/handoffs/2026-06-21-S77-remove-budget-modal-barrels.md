7) Commands run and outcome (pass/fail counts):
- PASS: `rg -n "@/components/budget/modals|components/budget/modals|..." ...` found no live imports of the barrel files; active budget page imports some modal implementations directly.
- PASS: `pnpm --dir frontend exec knip --config knip.json --no-exit-code --no-progress --reporter compact | rg 'src/components/budget/modals/(index\\.ts|index\\.tsx)|budget/modals/index|budget/modals' || true` reported both barrel files as unused before deletion.
- PASS: Deleted `frontend/src/components/budget/modals/index.ts` and `frontend/src/components/budget/modals/index.tsx`.
- PASS: Post-delete focused import search found no live imports of the deleted barrel paths. The only broad hit was the generated component graph directory node.
- PASS: Post-delete focused Knip check returned no `budget/modals/index` entries.
- PASS: File absence/preservation check confirmed both barrels are absent and active modal implementations remain present.
- PASS: `npm run check:routes`.
- PASS: `npm run verify:nonprod-routes`.
- PASS: `cd frontend && NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192' TYPECHECK_NO_TIMEOUT=1 npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`.
- PASS: `git diff --check -- <task-owned paths>`.
8) Evidence artifacts (screenshot/video/report/log paths):
- Command output in this Codex run.
9) Top 3 findings (frontend-visible issues first):
- No frontend-visible app change expected because the deleted files are unused barrels.
- Actual active budget modal implementation files remain untouched.
- Some implementation files are also Knip candidates, but they are intentionally out of scope for this slice.
10) Recommended next action (one line): Publish the narrow deletion batch, then accept the handoff and mark AAI-584 Done.
11) Handoff file path: docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-21-S77-remove-budget-modal-barrels.md
12) Migration ledger evidence: Not applicable; no database migration.

## Current Status

S77 removed the unused budget modal barrel files and preserved the actual modal
implementation files. Focused import search, Knip, route checks, file
absence/preservation, diff hygiene, and high-heap frontend typecheck passed.

## Known Pitfalls

- Do not delete actual budget modal implementation files in this slice.
- Do not stage unrelated local worktree dirt or reference clones.

## Resume Commands
