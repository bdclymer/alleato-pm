   - PASS: `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck:changed`.
   - PASS: Browser grid proof showed `CODEX-DRAFT-0623` in the normal grid with `Draft` and no `Review queue`.
   - PASS: Browser table proof showed `CODEX-DRAFT-0623` in the normal table with `Status` = `Draft` and no `Unpublished`.
   - PASS: Verification fixture cleanup deleted 1 drawing and 2 revisions.

9) Top 3 findings (frontend-visible issues first):
   - Fixed: removed the separate top-of-page review queue from the Drawings page.
   - Fixed: unpublished review-current revisions now appear in the normal Drawings grid/table/list as `Draft`.
   - Fixed: grid cards now use a destructive badge and red outline for draft drawings; table/list status text uses `Draft` or `Published`.
10) Recommended next action (one line): Continue Procore parity with metadata review controls, OCR confidence, rotation, and delete-from-batch inside the upload/revision workflow rather than adding a separate page-level queue.
11) Handoff file path: docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-23-S82-drawings-integrated-draft-state.md

## Linear Updates

- Kickoff comment: covered by AAI-614 S81 kickoff; this S82 handoff is the corrective implementation against the same issue.
- Milestone comments:
- Completion/blocker comment: d8319bb3-93df-45a9-b0fc-84523bd05900

## Current Status

Implemented and verified locally. Pending `codex:finish` publish.

## Exact Next Step

Run `npm run codex:finish -- --message "Integrate drawings draft state" --files ...` with the task-owned files only.

## Known Pitfalls

- Do not restore the separate top-of-page Review Queue table; draft state belongs in the existing Drawings views.
- Do not label draft rows as `Unpublished`; the user-facing status vocabulary here is `Draft` and `Published`.
- Do not include unrelated `frontend/src/components/tables/unified/unified-table-page.tsx` dirt in this slice.

## Resume Commands

```bash
npm run linear:codex:check -- docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-23-S82-drawings-integrated-draft-state.md
```

## Evidence

- Source queue-term scan - PASS.
- Targeted Jest - PASS.
- Targeted ESLint - PASS.
- Changed-file typecheck - PASS.
- Browser grid integrated draft state - PASS.
- Browser table integrated draft state - PASS.
- DB cleanup - PASS.
