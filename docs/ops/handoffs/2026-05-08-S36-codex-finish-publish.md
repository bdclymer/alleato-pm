9) Top 3 findings (frontend-visible issues first): No frontend-visible UI changes; existing checkout had unrelated dirty files, so the finish command requires explicit task-owned file paths by default; pre-existing staged files are blocked unless intentionally allowed.
10) Recommended next action (one line): Use `npm run codex:finish -- --message "<message>" --files <task-owned paths>` as the default closeout command for completed Codex tasks.
11) Handoff file path: docs/ops/handoffs/2026-05-08-S36-codex-finish-publish.md
12) Migration ledger evidence: Not applicable; no Supabase migration changed by this task.

## Linear Updates

- Kickoff comment: Posted to AAI-346 on 2026-05-08 with scope, planned files, and verification target.
- Milestone comments: Pending.
- Completion/blocker comment: Pending final Linear comment.

## Current Status

Added a focused `codex:finish` ops script and documented the default main-branch finish rule in `AGENTS.md`. Initial syntax/help/check-mode verification and Linear handoff validation passed. The implementation commit published to `origin/main` at `4544886fa`.

## Exact Next Step

Post the completion comment to AAI-346 and keep using `codex:finish` for future completed tasks.

## Known Pitfalls

The active checkout has unrelated dirty files. The finish flow must use explicit `--files` for this task-owned slice so unrelated work is not swept into the commit.

## Resume Commands

```bash
npm run codex:finish -- --check
node --check scripts/ops/codex-finish.mjs
npm run linear:codex:check -- docs/ops/handoffs/2026-05-08-S36-codex-finish-publish.md
npm run codex:finish -- --message "Add Codex main finish command" --files AGENTS.md package.json scripts/ops/codex-finish.mjs docs/ops/handoffs/2026-05-08-S36-codex-finish-publish.md docs/ops/orchestration/session-board.md docs/ops/orchestration/review-queue.md
```

## Evidence

- `node --check scripts/ops/codex-finish.mjs` passed.
- `npm run codex:finish -- --check` passed and reported `main` even with `origin/main`, while listing unrelated dirty checkout files.
- `node scripts/ops/codex-finish.mjs --help` passed.
- `npm run linear:codex:check -- docs/ops/handoffs/2026-05-08-S36-codex-finish-publish.md` passed.
- `npm run codex:finish -- --message "Add Codex main finish command" --staged-only` passed, ran route/check hooks, committed `4544886fa`, pushed `main`, and verified local `HEAD` matched `origin/main`.
