9) Top 3 findings (frontend-visible issues first):
   - Source-specific RAG contract is recovered: recent Teams evidence now carries explicit row-count coverage and indexed fallback observability before model synthesis.
   - Recent source lifecycle is not production-ready: project-assignment and generated-task assignment coverage are below thresholds across Fireflies, Teams, and Outlook.
   - Meeting vectorization for recent eligible meetings is recovered: official verifier now reports `75/75` recent meetings with embedded chunks. Historical Fireflies error backlog remains at `13225` rows and must be classified/drained separately.
   - Source lifecycle verifier is recovered: project disposition semantics now honor manual-review terminal states, and 162 deterministic task links were repaired from their source document projects.
   - Provider schedules do not fully match the target architecture: Render Acumatica, RAG health, AI provider health, and Microsoft Executive Assistant checks are suspended; Vercel Graph/Graph-embed/Acumatica crons are disabled but still present in repo config.
10) Recommended next action (one line): Continue with the next production-finalization phase after AAI-690 publish.
11) Handoff file path: docs/ops/handoffs/2026-06-25-S91-ai-rag-production-finalization-audit.md
12) Migration ledger evidence: No migration in this slice.

- Completion/blocker comment: Pending.

## Current Status

This is the first production-finalization slice for AAI-636. The final production architecture document now exists and is the comparison target. Compact verification has confirmed current blockers, so this audit cannot claim production readiness.

Follow-on sub-issues:

- AAI-638: source-specific RAG live Microsoft plus indexed fallback observability.
- AAI-639: source lifecycle project-assignment and task-assignment coverage.
- AAI-640: Fireflies ingestion error backlog and recent meeting vectorization gap.
- AAI-641: AI SDK MCP implementation gap or unused MCP dependency removal.

Current provider schedule findings:

- Render `alleato-acumatica-financial-sync` is suspended even though the target architecture requires scheduled Acumatica sync.
- Render `alleato-rag-health` and `alleato-ai-provider-health` are suspended even though target architecture requires meeting/vector and provider outage alerting.
- Render `alleato-microsoft-executive-assistant-check` is suspended even though target architecture calls for webhook plus scheduled fallback behavior for Microsoft assistant work.
- Vercel has `/api/cron/graph-sync`, `/api/cron/graph-embed`, and `/api/cron/acumatica-sync` registered but disabled; these are deletion/decommission candidates after route/import/provider proof.
- `rg` proof found the disabled Vercel Graph/Graph-embed/Acumatica cron paths only in `frontend/vercel.json` and their own route files; backend sync/embed endpoints remain active and should not be deleted.

AAI-640 progress:

- Root cause found: recent missing Fireflies rows were retryable `[Errno 35] Resource temporarily unavailable`, but canonical `run_full_pipeline` then failed after embedding because PM app final projection guards were treated as fatal ingestion errors.
- Code changed:
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/src/services/pipeline/extractor.py`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/src/services/pipeline/orchestrator.py`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/tests/test_meeting_signal_promotion.py`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/tests/test_pipeline_orchestrator.py`
- Bounded live repair:
  - Reprocessed `01KVD86PYMPG69CHFZ9CPZRQRC`, `01KVTVXHPJPBX9YD4YBXW6DNCW`, `01KVDGP7KYSBHEZCA89CJYN3RN`, and `01KVDGP7KGPTRWD1PC7T4S8S4D`.
  - Official meeting verifier passed afterward.
- Remaining blockers:
  - Historical Fireflies backlog remains, dominated by manually paused 2026-05-13 rows.
  - Structured extraction provider contract is noisy: several model calls reject `response_format=json_object` and fallback can still return non-JSON.

AAI-639 progress:

- Root cause found: source lifecycle was measuring direct project assignment only, not the final architecture's project disposition contract. Ambiguous items with `project_assignment_review` were being treated as failed even though they were routed to manual review. Separately, generated task failures included stale task rows that could be deterministically linked from `document_metadata.project_id`.
- Code changed:
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/scripts/verify/verify_source_lifecycle_health.mjs`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/scripts/verify/source_lifecycle_project_applicability.mjs`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/scripts/verify/backfill_project_assignments_from_compiler_jobs.mjs`
- Data repair:
  - Updated 162 task rows from linked source document project IDs.
  - No ambiguous source documents were auto-assigned.
- Verification:
  - Source lifecycle verifier passed.
  - Fireflies task integrity passed with 0 link violations.

AAI-638 progress:

- Root cause found: source-specific Teams retrieval already checked live Microsoft Graph and the indexed Supabase fallback, but the Teams synthesis evidence block did not include the exact Teams row-count observability required by the contract verifier.
- Code changed:
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/frontend/src/lib/ai/retrieval/source-specific-rag.ts`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/frontend/src/lib/ai/retrieval/__tests__/source-specific-rag.test.ts`
- Verification:
  - Focused source-specific RAG Jest test passed.
  - Source-specific contract verifier passed.

The current repo has unrelated dirty files, so any further implementation changes must remain isolated to owned files.

AAI-669 progress:

- Scope: SharePoint/PDF/uploaded document OCR, vision, embedding, citation metadata, and RAG chunk integrity.
- Code changed:
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/src/services/integrations/microsoft_graph/embed.py`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/src/services/pipeline/vision_analyzer.py`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/tests/test_graph_embed.py`
- Production/data repair:
  - Deployed automatic Graph vision path on Render for commit `238b56c8e0824e5ad5d258d3f8ddce3108fd1d9b`.
  - Repaired OneDrive vision gaps, drawing-upload vision gaps, OneDrive OCR-failed rows through vision-only/vector fallback, Outlook metadata-only PDF attachments through Graph `$value`, and small manual text uploads through the canonical document parser/embedder.
  - Final tracked candidate inventory: 66/66 covered, 0 active missing.
- Root causes confirmed:
  - Graph PDF embedding required text before running vision, blocking vision-only searchable records when OCR failed.
  - Successful Graph embedding updated existing RAG metadata only, so vision-only chunks could be left without citation/status metadata.
  - Outlook promoted attachment metadata had no stored PDF and stored Outlook ids were not valid for direct attachment detail fetch; resolving by `internet_message_id` and downloading matched attachments through Graph `$value` works.
- Verification:
  - PASS: `python3 -m py_compile backend/src/services/integrations/microsoft_graph/embed.py backend/src/services/pipeline/vision_analyzer.py backend/tests/test_graph_embed.py`
  - PASS: `PYTHONPATH=backend backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests/test_graph_embed.py -q`

AAI-682 progress:

- Scope: vector retrieval filters, duplicate/noise chunk handling, citation metadata guardrails, hybrid retrieval quality, and assistant readiness.
- Code changed:
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/src/services/pipeline/document_parser.py`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/src/services/pipeline/embedder.py`

  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/docs/ops/evidence/2026-06-25-ai-rag-production-finalization/vector-retrieval-path-inventory-aai-682.md`
  - AAI-682 evidence files under `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/docs/ops/evidence/2026-06-25-ai-rag-production-finalization/`
- Root cause confirmed:
  - `run_document_parser` converted low-content documents into fake summaries/segments with text like `Minimal extract... Parsed content was only 0 characters...`.
  - `run_embedder` embedded those fake summaries as `meeting_summary`, `meeting_segment_summary`, `meeting_summary_embed`, and `teams_channel` chunks.
  - Hybrid ranking failed because it sampled and retrieved indexed placeholder text, not because the embedding provider or vector RPC was down.
- Data repair:
  - Deleted 67 live RAG placeholder chunks matching the low-content placeholder pattern.
  - Updated 16 placeholder-only `rag_document_metadata` rows to `skipped_low_content`.
  - Mirrored `skipped_low_content` to 16 app `document_metadata` rows.
  - Mixed documents with real chunks retained their real chunks; only placeholder chunks were deleted.
- Prevention:
  - Low-content documents no longer create fake parser summaries or segments.
  - Embedder now supports no-segment vision-only documents when real `document_page_intelligence` summaries exist.
  - Embedder explicitly marks no-text/no-vision documents as `skipped_low_content`, deletes stale chunks, and does not call embedding.
  - `verify_rag_chunk_integrity.mjs` now fails on low-content placeholder chunks.
  - `verify_ai_assistant_operational_readiness.mjs` now loads the active `docs/ai-plan2/evals/assistant-eval-suite.json` instead of a missing archive path.
- Verification:
  - PASS: `python3 -m py_compile backend/src/services/pipeline/document_parser.py backend/src/services/pipeline/embedder.py backend/tests/test_document_low_content_pipeline.py`
  - PASS: `PYTHONPATH=backend backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests/test_document_low_content_pipeline.py backend/tests/test_graph_embed.py -q`
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:chunk-integrity -- --days=2`
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:hybrid-ranking`
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:source-specific`
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:response-contract`
  - FAIL: `npm run rag:verify:assistant-operational-readiness` now reaches real assertions and fails because `backendDeepAgentExecutiveBriefing` is required by the architecture/eval suite but is not attached by the live handler.
  - FAIL: `npm run verify:metadata-boundary` still flags heavy app `document_metadata.content/raw_text` reads in parser/embedder and document-intelligence paths.
  - FAIL: `npm run verify:client-boundary` still flags the admin AI work-runs route reading RAG-owned `source_sync_runs` without `createRagServiceClient()`.
  - FAIL: `npm run verify:backend-client-boundary` still flags Outlook intake reads that need the AI DB resolver in email digest and Microsoft executive assistant paths.
  - PASS after follow-up: `npm run rag:verify:assistant-operational-readiness` passes after restoring the canonical `backendDeepAgentExecutiveBriefing` handler path.
  - PASS after follow-up: `npm run rag:verify:metadata-boundary` passes after moving AI/RAG heavy body-text reads off app `document_metadata`.
  - PASS after follow-up: `npm run rag:verify:client-boundary` passes after routing admin `source_sync_runs` reads through `createRagServiceClient()`.
  - PASS after follow-up: `npm run rag:verify:backend-client-boundary` passes after routing Outlook intake control-plane reads/writes through AI DB resolver helpers.
  - PASS after follow-up: delegated sub-agent typecheck `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck` passed with no errors.
  - PASS after follow-up: focused lint passed for `frontend/src/app/api/admin/ai-work-runs/route.ts` and `frontend/src/lib/ai/tools/document-intelligence.ts`.
  - PASS after follow-up: Python compile passed for touched backend parser/embedder/backfill/digest/assistant files.
  - PASS after follow-up: `npm run rag:verify:retrieval-contract` validates live `search_document_chunks` project/source filters, duplicate top-chunk prevention, citation/reference metadata, and static service-role permission guard hooks.
  - PASS after follow-up: delegated sub-agent typechecks after retrieval-contract verifier edits passed with no errors.
  - PASS after follow-up: legacy retrieval inventory completed. No production retrieval code was deleted because import/route proof showed the old-looking paths are active backend/API/admin-eval workflows or manual/dev-only candidates requiring separate cleanup.
  - PASS final: AAI-682 closeout bundle passed chunk integrity, hybrid ranking, source-specific contract, retrieval contract, response contract, assistant operational readiness, metadata boundary, frontend RAG client boundary, and backend RAG client boundary.

AAI-690 continued progress:

- Code changed:
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/src/services/pipeline/extractor.py`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/backend/tests/test_meeting_signal_promotion.py`
- Data repair:
  - Applied 7 deterministic OneDrive/SharePoint assignments from source-path project numbers.
  - Did not apply SharePoint AP-check assignment because the deterministic AP repair found 81 parsed check documents and 0 safe exact matches.
- Root cause:
  - Legacy Fireflies action-item tasks were classified as `fireflies_pipeline_legacy` without a required prompt version, so the task-quality database trigger rejected redrive writes.
- Prevention:
  - Added `LEGACY_FIREFLIES_TASK_PROMPT_VERSION`.
  - Added a regression test that legacy Fireflies task writes include the prompt version.
- Verification:
  - PASS: `python3 -m py_compile backend/src/services/pipeline/extractor.py backend/tests/test_meeting_signal_promotion.py`
  - PASS: `PYTHONPATH=backend backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests/test_meeting_signal_promotion.py -q`
  - PASS: delegated sub-agent typecheck `TYPECHECK_NO_TIMEOUT=1 npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:source-lifecycle` after Fireflies redrive
- SharePoint disposition closeout:
  - Applied current-state lifecycle normalization over the active 7-day Microsoft window.
  - Repaired 124 stale legacy `sharepoint` lifecycle rows from complete/no-project to project-assignment review.
  - Postcheck found 0 remaining no-project terminal SharePoint rows in the active window.
- Task association closeout:
  - Repaired 4 generated task scalar/array mismatches.
  - Final active-window task coverage has 0 duplicate task groups and 0 scalar/array mismatches.

  - AAI-690 evidence files under `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/docs/ops/evidence/2026-06-25-ai-rag-production-finalization/`
- Root cause confirmed:
  - Stale Fireflies task rows had scalar project values populated but project arrays empty or mismatched.
  - Current Fireflies task writers already populate project arrays; the first failure was historical drift.
  - A stricter duplicate/link check then found task-level attribution repairs had set scalar projects from task text without updating project arrays.
  - Recent Outlook/Teams communication docs had no synthesizer markers and no task rows because event-driven extraction was gated on inline embedding, while Teams scheduled phases skip embedding.
  - Signal promotion failures blocked task creation for a document, and shared task upsert did not mirror scalar project IDs into task project arrays for communication task writes.
- Data repair:
  - Fireflies source-document task repair updated 76 task links and 0 document rows.
  - Fireflies task-attribution sync assigned 5 additional tasks from deterministic task text.
  - Fireflies task-attribution sync updated 48 existing project arrays from scalar project values.
- Prevention:
  - `backfill_project_assignments_from_compiler_jobs.mjs` now supports `--source-system` and `--tasks-only`.
  - `backfill_task_project_assignments_from_rules.mjs` now supports `--source-system` and `--sync-existing-project-ids`; future task-text project assignments populate task project arrays.
  - `backfill_project_assignments_from_attribution_rules.mjs` now populates task project arrays when assigning linked document tasks.
  - Python guardrail test proves extractor `_upsert_task` persists project arrays with scalar projects.
  - Graph sync now triggers project synthesizer after new Outlook/Teams communication items even when inline embedding is skipped.
  - Project synthesizer records signal-promotion errors without blocking task writes.
  - Shared task writer mirrors scalar project IDs into task project arrays for every source.
  - Dead email/Teams compiler-title unit test was migrated to the active project synthesizer task writer path.

- Remaining blocker:
- AAI-690 is closed. Document-analysis task generation, unmatched manual-review routing, and remaining SharePoint/upload/drawing/RFI/contract assignment evidence were completed in the follow-up AAI-690 closeout and reflected in `docs/ops/tasks/2026-06-25-project-assignment-task-generation-e2e.md`.

AAI-697 progress:

- Scope: Acumatica retry/fallback behavior, logging, sync statistics, and duplicate-import prevention.
- Linear issue: AAI-697.
- Code changed:
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/scripts/verify/verify-acumatica-sync-health.mjs`

- Root cause confirmed:
  - The Acumatica health verifier still used a 180-minute default freshness threshold even though production now runs twice daily. That made healthy twice-daily state fail between scheduled runs.
- Prevention:
  - The health verifier now defaults to 780 minutes, matching the twice-daily cadence plus one hour of scheduler/provider jitter.
  - The verifier still reads live Render schedule state and required entity freshness, so schedule drift and stale required syncs fail loudly.
- Verification:
  - PASS: `npm run verify:acumatica-sync-health` after stale-threshold fix. Output confirmed Render cron `not_suspended`, schedule `0 0,12 * * *`, command `python3 scripts/run_acumatica_financial_sync.py`, 12 checked entities, and PASS.
  - PASS: Acumatica sync run/state proof found stats coverage for all 12 required entities and persisted `last_stats` in `acumatica_sync_state`.
  - PASS: Warning/fallback proof found persisted warning runs for unsupported customer fields and missing historical payment-application endpoint; payment applications fall back to projection from `acumatica_payments` where customer-to-project mapping is unique.
  - PASS: Duplicate prevention proof found upsert/conflict-key code guardrails, live unique indexes, and zero duplicate groups across 18 Acumatica raw/projection duplicate probes.
  - PASS: delegated sub-agent typecheck `TYPECHECK_NO_TIMEOUT=1 npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`.
- Residual risk:
  - Historical AR payment application detail still needs an Acumatica Generic Inquiry or endpoint exposure for full fidelity. It is not silent and is not blocking this slice because the current production path logs the warning and projects payment records through the supported fallback.
- Remaining blocker:
  - No active blocker inside AAI-697. The slice is ready to publish.

AAI-698 progress:

- Scope: final AI assistant prompt/tool/RAG architecture verification and repair.
- Linear issue: AAI-698.
- Code changed:
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/frontend/src/app/api/ai-assistant/chat/handler-v2.ts`
  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/frontend/src/lib/ai/retrieval/deps.ts`

  - `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/docs/ops/evidence/2026-06-25-ai-rag-production-finalization/frontend-typecheck-final-aai-698.txt`
  - AAI-698 verifier evidence files under `/Users/meganharrison/Documents/alleato-pm/docs/ops/evidence/2026-06-25-ai-rag-production-finalization/`
- Root cause confirmed:
  - Several deterministic assistant workflows still fell through to broad model/tool-loop behavior: RFI create prompts, Teams/source lookup questions, executive briefing metadata follow-ups, personal task source citation output, and named-project packet-first briefings.
  - Named project briefings could miss project resolution from text and then enter huge model/tool loops with empty or timed-out streams.
- Prevention:
  - Added deterministic, persisted, traceable routes for preview-only RFI creation, direct semantic source lookup, executive briefing metadata lookup, personal task source citations, and direct project briefing from loaded RAG context.
  - Added permission-scoped `projects.name` fallback resolution in retrieval deps when intelligence-target resolution misses.
  - Preserved required trace names for evaluator/operator evidence: `intentPlanner`, `sourceLookupIntentRouter`, `executiveBriefingMetadataLookup`, `getMyTasks`, `serverBusinessContextPreflight`, `getProjectBriefingSnapshot`, and `semanticSearch`.
- Verification:
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:assistant-routing` with 6/6 tests passing.
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:chat-architecture`.
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:assistant-operational-readiness`.
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:source-specific`.
  - PASS: `npm run verify:microsoft-assistant-health -- --json`.
  - PASS: `npm run rag:verify:source-lifecycle -- --days 7`.
  - PASS: `PROJECT_ATTRIBUTION_AUDIT_DAYS=7 npm run verify:project-attribution`.
  - PASS: delegated sub-agent `TYPECHECK_NO_TIMEOUT=1 npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`.
- Residual risk:
  - Outlook redrive synced and embedded current mail, but the downstream intelligence extraction phase still reports the existing high-churn write guard for source-signal/intelligence/task tables. This is not blocking AAI-698 assistant routing/RAG architecture, but it is the next event-driven intelligence/task-write blocker before final platform readiness.

- Remaining blocker:
  - No active blocker inside AAI-698.

## Exact Next Step

Publish AAI-698, then create the next cleanup slice for event-driven Outlook/Teams intelligence/task writes blocked by the high-churn AI/intelligence database-write guard before final all-pipeline verification and Phase 12 deletion-candidate proof.

## Known Pitfalls

- Do not treat archived docs as proof that a code path is inactive.
- Do not delete stale-looking code until provider schedules, route references, imports, and database writes prove it is not production-owned.
- Do not collapse Fireflies, Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint failures into one generic embedding verdict; source-scoped reporting is required.
- Do not claim production readiness from HTTP 200 alone; prove sync, parse/OCR, embedding, project assignment, task generation, retrieval, and assistant use.
- Do not treat the target architecture document as proof that current production matches it.
