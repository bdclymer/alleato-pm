- PASS: `node scripts/verify/verify_render_ai_gateway_health.mjs` confirmed active Render backend health, AI Gateway configured, Supabase service configured, and AI Gateway balance above floor.
- PASS: active backend endpoint probe against `https://alleato-backend-rbnj.onrender.com/api/intelligence/deep-agent/project-status` returned expected 503 disabled state before non-production flags are enabled.
- PASS: `npm run rag:verify:deep-agents-nonprod` verifies Render manifest default-off flags, active backend health, endpoint state, and Render API service-mapping drift.
- FAIL deployment mapping: `RENDER_API_KEY` currently does not expose the active `alleato-backend-rbnj` service; do not mutate backend env vars through any other backend service record.
- PASS: `npm run verify:active-backend-url` now scans tracked docs/code plus local `.vercel`, `frontend/.vercel`, `frontend/.env.local`, `.claude`, and `claude-memory-compiler-main`; only `alleato-backend-rbnj.onrender.com` is allowed for Render backend URLs.

- PASS: Vercel env values for `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_ENDPOINT`, `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL`, and `BACKEND_URL` were reset to `https://alleato-backend-rbnj.onrender.com` for production, development, preview, and preview `staging`; temp pulls for production/preview/staging found no stale backend host strings.
- FAIL expected: `npm run rag:verify:deep-agents-nonprod` now refuses to pass while the local `RENDER_API_KEY` cannot see the active `alleato-backend-rbnj` service.
- WARN existing provider debt: `node scripts/verify/verify_ai_tool_calling_provider_matrix.mjs` exited 0 and refreshed `docs/ai-plan/evals/ai-tool-calling-provider-matrix-2026-04-30.json`, but the artifact currently reports `supportsToolCalling=false`; gateway `generateText` passed, direct OpenAI quota failed, and streamText paths did not produce a passing tool-call result.
- FAIL unrelated auth dependency: `npm run rag:verify:assistant-routing` failed in setup before route assertions because Supabase Auth timed out during `listUsers` after 30000ms in `frontend/tests/auth.setup.ts`.
- WARN unrelated environment debt: backend `.venv` emits `RequestsDependencyWarning` for `urllib3`/`chardet` or `charset_normalizer` version mismatch.
- FAIL unrelated: `python -m pytest backend/tests/test_deep_project_intelligence.py backend/tests/test_api_routes.py -q` failed in legacy Fireflies ingestion endpoint tests because the shared test harness still exposes the mocked admin dependency as required `args`/`kwargs` query params. New Deep Agents tests passed in the same run.

9) Top 3 findings (frontend-visible issues first):
- Deep Agents should not replace AI SDK UI/chat transport; it should be evaluated as a backend orchestration harness for complex project-intelligence workflows.
- Current repo evidence already has packet-first intelligence and AI SDK tool loops, but the product contract is distributed across route branches, fallbacks, and quality checks.
- Slice 3B now adds a feature-gated AI SDK bridge that calls the backend Deep Agents packet for selected-project owner-status/risk intents without moving LangChain into frontend code; local Deep Agents runtime now succeeds through AI Gateway.
- Non-production readiness is now guarded: default-off Render flags are declared in both manifests, active backend health passes, and stale Render service mapping is explicit.
10) Recommended next action (one line): Resolve active Render service API access or enable the Deep Agents env vars through the active Render dashboard, then run `DEEP_AGENTS_EXPECT_ENABLED=true npm run rag:verify:deep-agents-nonprod` and one authenticated selected-project owner-status prompt through `/api/ai-assistant/chat`.

## Current Status

Created an architecture PRP that evaluates LangChain Deep Agents as a backend project-intelligence orchestrator while keeping the AI SDK as the chat/UI integration layer.

The PRP includes the framework boundary, current repo evidence, pilot request/response contracts, subagent shape, backend integration slices, non-goals, risks, guardrails, and verification commands.

Implemented Slice 1 as a backend-only contract spike:

- Added Pydantic request/response contracts for the pilot packet.
- Added `build_project_status_contract_spike(...)`.
- Added `POST /api/intelligence/deep-agent/project-status`, gated by `DEEP_AGENTS_PROJECT_INTELLIGENCE_ENABLED=true`.
- Added focused tests for explicit missing source coverage, project lookup failure, feature-gate behavior, successful contract response, and 404 on unresolved project.

Implemented Slice 2 as read-only source coverage probes:

- Added source probes for packet, Teams, meetings, emails, documents, financials, schedule, RFIs, and submittals.
- Added bounded project-filtered table reads through the existing backend Supabase store.
- Added per-source `checked`, `missing`, and `failed` statuses.
- Added per-source `toolTrace` entries.
- Added sample evidence extraction from source rows.
- Kept the endpoint backend-only and environment-gated.

Implemented Slice 3A as a backend-only Deep Agents runtime hook:

- Added `deepagents>=0.6.1` and `langchain-openai>=0.3.0` to backend requirements.
- Added lazy `create_deep_agent` invocation behind `DEEP_AGENTS_PROJECT_INTELLIGENCE_RUNTIME=deep_agents`.
- Fed the runtime only pre-collected source coverage/evidence, not broad DB tools.
- Added `deepagents_runtime` success/failure traces.
- Runtime failure falls back to the contract response instead of returning a generic error.
- Added an installed-graph regression test that clears the backend test harness's old `langchain` stub, imports real `deepagents`, and proves `create_deep_agent` can synthesize through the backend contract using a tool-bindable fake model.

Implemented Slice 3B as a feature-gated AI SDK bridge:

- Added `frontend/src/lib/ai/deep-agent-project-status.ts` as the server-side typed client for `POST /api/intelligence/deep-agent/project-status`.
- Kept the bridge behind `AI_ASSISTANT_DEEP_AGENT_BRIDGE_ENABLED=true` and limited it to selected-project `target_briefing`, `latest_status`, and `risk_review` intents.
- Injected the backend packet as additive AI SDK system context instead of replacing the chat stream.
- Rendered backend evidence through the existing `source_evidence_drawer` assistant widget type.
- Recorded success/failure in `toolTrace`; failures are visible warning statuses and then fall back to current packet/tools.
- Verified the bridge against a local backend: project 43 returned a typed packet with checked packet/Teams/email/financial/schedule sources and 10 evidence rows.
- Hardened backend project lookup so Supabase/schema-cache failures return a structured low-confidence packet with failed `project_lookup` trace instead of a generic 500.
- Verified installed Deep Agents runtime handoff behavior: when direct OpenAI quota fails, `deepagents_runtime` is recorded as failed and the endpoint still returns the contract packet.
- Routed runtime model creation through AI Gateway when `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is present, with direct OpenAI retained only as a fallback.
- Verified local Deep Agents runtime against AI Gateway: project 43 returned `mode=deep_agents`, nine source categories, 11 evidence rows, and a successful `deepagents_runtime` trace.
- Added default-off Deep Agents env entries to both Render manifests so production does not accidentally enable the runtime.
- Added `scripts/verify/verify_deep_agents_nonprod_readiness.mjs` and `npm run rag:verify:deep-agents-nonprod` to make the active backend, endpoint state, AI Gateway health, manifest defaults, and stale Render service mapping visible before rollout.

Known ledger issue: local `session-board.md` already has an older S44 row using `AAI-356` for Source Sync drill-in work. The live Linear issue created for this session is also `AAI-356`. This is recorded as a ledger collision risk rather than hidden.

## Exact Next Step

Resolve the active Render service API mapping or enable `DEEP_AGENTS_PROJECT_INTELLIGENCE_ENABLED=true`, `DEEP_AGENTS_PROJECT_INTELLIGENCE_RUNTIME=deep_agents`, and `DEEP_AGENTS_PROJECT_INTELLIGENCE_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini` through the active `alleato-backend-rbnj` Render dashboard. Then set `AI_ASSISTANT_DEEP_AGENT_BRIDGE_ENABLED=true` on Vercel preview and run `DEEP_AGENTS_EXPECT_ENABLED=true npm run rag:verify:deep-agents-nonprod` plus one real selected-project owner-status prompt end to end through the app.

## Known Pitfalls

- Do not replace AI SDK UI or existing AI Elements.
- Do not introduce LangChain/Deep Agents into frontend code.
- Do not let the pilot bypass existing packet-first tables or source-health ledgers.
- Do not call the pilot successful unless missing/stale/failed source categories are explicit in the response.
- Do not treat read-only probes as final answer synthesis; they are coverage inputs for a future orchestrator.
- Do not enable runtime in production until non-production proves model/provider compatibility.
- Do not enable the frontend bridge without a backend URL and `ADMIN_API_KEY`; the bridge intentionally fails loudly into `toolTrace` when backend configuration is missing.
- Resolve or annotate the local AAI-356 session-board collision before broader orchestration cleanup.
