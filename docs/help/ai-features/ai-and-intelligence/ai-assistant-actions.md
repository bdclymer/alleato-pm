# What the AI Assistant Can Do (Actions)

Ask Alleato can create and update records directly from chat. For any action that writes to the database, the assistant shows you a preview and waits for your confirmation before making any changes.

## How the Confirmation Flow Works

1. You ask the assistant to create or update something (e.g., "Create an RFI about the electrical panel clearance issue").
2. The assistant shows a **preview card** with the exact fields it will write — no changes have been made yet.
3. Reply **confirm** (or click the Confirm button) to execute the write.
4. The assistant confirms the record was created and links to it.

If the preview looks wrong, describe the correction before confirming. You can also reply **cancel** to abort.

## Available Write Actions

### Requires Confirmation

These actions write financial or sensitive records and always show a preview first.

| Action | What It Creates |
|--------|----------------|
| Create Change Order | A prime contract change order linked to a project |
| Create Change Event | A potential change event with cost and schedule impact |
| Update Project Status | Changes the status field on a project |
| Create RFI | A new Request for Information with subject, question, ball-in-court, and due date |
| Flag Project Risk | An AI insight record flagging a risk with type, severity, and description |
| Create Commitment | A subcontract or purchase order for a vendor |

### No Confirmation Required

These actions create lower-impact records that can be reversed or edited easily.

| Action | What It Creates |
|--------|----------------|
| Create Task | A schedule task with title, assignee, start/end dates |
| Update RFI Status | Changes the status of an existing RFI |
| Create Meeting Note | A meeting document entry |
| Create Submittal | A submittal log entry |
| Log Daily Report | A daily log entry |
| Save to Knowledge Base | Saves a fact, lesson, or process note to the company knowledge base |
| Save Insight | Saves a structured insight (risk, decision, cost impact) linked to a project |

## Example Prompts

```
"Create an RFI for the fire suppression head clearance issue. Ball in court is the MEP engineer. Due in 5 days."

"Log a risk on Vermillion Rise — delayed steel delivery is threatening the Phase 2 schedule."

"Create a subcontract with Apex Electric for the panel upgrades, $85,000."

"Mark RFI #42 as closed."

"Create a task for Sarah to submit the submittal log update by Friday."

"Save this to the knowledge base: always include a 10% contingency on tilt-up panel pours."
```

## Safety Rules

- The assistant never executes a financial write without showing a preview first.
- The assistant never approves, signs, or pays on your behalf.
- Write access is scoped to projects you have permission to edit. If a project is outside your access, the action is blocked.
- All write actions are logged with your user ID and a timestamp.
