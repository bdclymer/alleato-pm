# Change Event to Change Order Workflow

Follow a scope change from initial capture through owner-approved change order and budget update.

## Overview

Every change to the project's scope, cost, or schedule starts as a **Change Event** and ends as an approved **Change Order**. The workflow has four stages:

1. **Capture** — create a Change Event and price the work
2. **Review** — get internal and owner approval on the Change Event
3. **Convert** — generate a Change Order from the approved Change Event
4. **Close** — obtain owner signature and watch the budget update

---

## Stage 1 — Capture the Change Event

1. Open **Change Events** from the project sidebar.
2. Select **Create Change Event**.
3. Enter a **Title** and **Description** that clearly identifies the scope change.
4. Set the **Type**:
   - **Owner-Initiated** — the owner is requesting additional work
   - **Field Condition** — unforeseen site condition
   - **Design Change** — modification from the architect or engineer
   - **Subcontractor PCO** — subcontractor-submitted potential change order
5. Set the **Originator**, **Date**, and any **RFI** or **Drawing** references.
6. Add cost line items: select the **Cost Code**, **Cost Type**, quantity, and unit cost.
7. Attach supporting documents (photos, RFIs, markup drawings).
8. Save the Change Event. Status is now **Open**.

> If the change involves subcontractor pricing, collect their PCO before entering cost line items. The total on the Change Event should reflect your cost-to-owner estimate, not the sub's raw number.

---

## Stage 2 — Price and Internal Review

1. Open the Change Event and review all line items.
2. Add markup, overhead, and profit as separate line items if your contract requires it.
3. When pricing is complete, change the status to **Pending**.
4. Route internally for review. When your PM or project executive has signed off, advance to **In Review**.

**In Review** means the Change Event is ready to present to the owner. No further cost edits should happen after this point without resetting to **Pending**.

---

## Stage 3 — Owner Approval

1. Present the Change Event to the owner (share the PDF or direct link).
2. If the owner approves verbally or in writing, set the status to **Approved**.
3. If the owner requests revisions, set to **Pending**, revise pricing, and re-route.
4. If the owner declines, set to **Rejected** or **Void**.

Only **Approved** Change Events can be included in a Change Order.

---

## Stage 4 — Generate the Change Order

1. Open **Change Orders** from the sidebar.
2. Select **Create Change Order**.
3. Select the **Approved Change Events** to bundle into this Change Order.
   - Multiple Change Events can be grouped into a single CO.
   - Each Change Event can only be used in one Change Order.
4. Enter the **CO Number**, **Title**, **Description**, and **Effective Date**.
5. Review the line items and total value pulled from the selected Change Events.
6. Save as **Draft**.

---

## Stage 5 — Approve and Close the Change Order

1. Open the Change Order draft.
2. Select **Generate PDF** to produce the formatted change order with cover sheet, line items, and signature block.
3. Send the PDF to the owner for countersignature.
4. When signed, advance the status to **Approved**.

Once the Change Order is **Approved**:
- The amount flows into the **Approved Changes** column on the budget
- The **Revised Budget** updates automatically on all affected cost codes
- The prime contract total updates on the [Prime Contracts](/docs/prime-contracts) page

## Common Questions

**Can I create a Change Order without a Change Event?**
No. Change Orders must be generated from one or more Approved Change Events. This ensures every dollar in a CO is traceable to a specific scope item.

**Can I edit a Change Event after it's Approved?**
No. Reset the status to Pending, make your edits, then re-route through In Review and back to Approved.

**What if the owner approves a partial amount?**
Split the Change Event into two: one for the approved scope and one for the disputed scope. Approve only the first, and leave the second in review.

**When does the budget update?**
The budget updates when the Change Order reaches **Approved** status — not when the Change Event is approved.
