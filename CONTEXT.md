# CONTEXT — domain glossary & architecture vocabulary

The shared names for concepts in this codebase. Architecture reviews and the
`/improve-codebase-architecture`, `/codebase-design`, and `/domain-modeling` skills use
this file as the source of truth for domain terms. When a deepened module is named after a
concept, its term goes here.

Architecture vocabulary (module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality)
comes from the `/codebase-design` skill — this file only defines the **domain**.

## Invoicing / payment applications

**Payment application** — an AIA G702/G703 application for payment: a schedule-of-values
(SOV) rollup that certifies how much is due on a contract for a billing period. The same
9-line certificate schedule applies to both subcontractor invoices and owner/prime
payment applications.

**Invoice financials** — the money calculation behind a payment application: per-line
figures (completed/stored, retainage) plus the 9-line rollup. Owned by one deep module,
`frontend/src/lib/invoicing/payment-application.ts`, and consumed by the subcontractor
invoice route, the SOV editor tabs, the PDF, and (fast-follow) the prime side. Before this
module the math was forked across four call sites that disagreed on Lines 8 and 9.

**The G702 nine lines** (the canonical certificate schedule):
1. Original Contract Sum
2. Net Change by Change Orders
3. Contract Sum to Date (1 ± 2)
4. Total Completed & Stored to Date
5. Retainage (5a % of completed work + 5b % of stored material)
6. Total Earned Less Retainage (4 − 5)
7. Less Previous Certificates for Payment
8. **Current Payment Due** (6 − 7)
9. **Balance to Finish, Including Retainage** (3 − 6)

**Retainage** — a withheld portion of a contract amount (commonly 5–10%) held until work
is satisfactorily complete. Tracked per line for work and stored materials, split into
this-period / previous / released.

**Retainage release** — a first-class Procore subcontractor-invoice type where previously
withheld retainage is paid out. On a release, Current Payment Due (Line 8) is the released
amount rather than the standard `6 − 7`. The module must handle this case; the prime-side
calc historically did not.

**SOV line item (`SovLineItem`)** — one schedule-of-values row on a payment application.
Per-line stored figures (`net_amount_this_period`, `total_completed_stored`) are Postgres
GENERATED columns — the database is the single source of truth for stored per-line values;
the module recomputes them only for edit **preview** and is pinned to the DB expression by
a parity test.

## Data access / Supabase project routing

**Service data router** — the one module that answers "for this table, which Supabase
project, which service-role client, and which generated-types generic?" Exposed as
`serviceDb.from(table)` (planned home: `frontend/src/lib/supabase/service-db.ts`). It owns
the table→project decision *by construction*: it selects the client and calls `.from()`
itself, returning the native Supabase query builder already bound to the right project — so
the table you route on is the table you query, and querying the wrong project is
unrepresentable. The same map drives the return type (`<Database>` for PM-APP tables,
`<RagDatabase>` for AI-DB tables), so a client can no longer be typed for the wrong project
(the `createOutlookIntakeServiceClient` mistype). Scope is the **service-role** surface only
(~470 call sites): RAG is reached exclusively via service-role, so RLS cookie/browser paths
are always PM-APP, already correct, and are left untouched. Two adapters sit behind the
seam — the PM-app service client and the RAG service client (today's `createServiceClient` /
`createRagServiceClient`), constructed once and hidden. Before this module the
project choice was leaked across ~1,300 call sites and re-derived from developer memory,
a lint array, and a DB trigger — the recurring "wrong DB" incident class.

**RAG table registry** — the single exported allowlist of tables that physically live in the
**AI Database** (`document_chunks`, `rag_document_metadata`, `rag_pipeline_state`,
`outlook_email_intake*`, and their siblings). It is the one source of truth the Service data
router routes on, replacing the three scattered copies that exist today: the
`KNOWN_EXTERNAL_TABLES` array in `scripts/audits/check-no-phantom-doc-tables.mjs` (used only
to silence a linter), the "rule of thumb" prose in `CLAUDE.md`, and every developer's memory.
A completeness test pins it to `RagDatabase["public"]["Tables"]` so it can't drift when
types regenerate. Note the legacy overlap: `document_chunks` / `rag_pipeline_state` still
exist in the PM-APP project as trigger-protected read-only copies, so membership is an
explicit allowlist, not "is it absent from the PM-APP types."

**RAG-unconfigured = loud throw (never PM-APP fallback)** — when a RAG table is routed but
`RAG_SUPABASE_URL` is missing, the router throws a specific error rather than falling back to
the PM-APP client. Silent fallback is what "makes the inbox look empty even when sync is
healthy" (the reason `createOutlookIntakeServiceClient` was added as a workaround). The
router owns this drift check; the Python side already has the equivalent
(`rag_supabase_configured()`).

## Identity resolution

**Identity resolution** — the operation "given the authenticated user, what are their id
shapes?". Owned by `frontend/src/lib/auth/identity.ts`: `resolvePersonId(user)` and
`resolveIdentity(user) → { authUserId, profileId, personId }`. Two distinct ids identify a
user, and stamping the wrong one into a write column — which RLS then silently hides — is a
recurring bug class:
- **`authUserId`** — Supabase `auth.users.id`. Equal to **`user_profiles.id`** by
  construction (routes read the profile via `.eq("id", authUserId)`), so
  `profileId === authUserId`.
- **`personId`** — `people.id`, a SEPARATE id bridged from the auth uid via
  `users_auth.auth_user_id → person_id`. Required by `people`-FK write columns.

The bridge walk (users_auth → `people.auth_user_id` → `people.email` → auto-provision) has
ONE home, `resolvePersonId`. Before it, the walk was a private copy in `auth-guard.ts` plus
~6 inline hand-rolled forward walks (in `api/commitments`, `api/auth/admin-check`,
`api/projects` ×2, and two `directory/people/.../notifications` routes) that skip the
fallback chain and so behave differently for un-backfilled accounts. Those forks should
adopt `resolvePersonId`.

**Write id-shape contract** — which id a "who did this" column wants is a per-`{table,
column}` fact, NOT per-column-name (`submitted_by` / `reviewed_by` / `assigned_by` each
mean BOTH shapes across different tables). Only 15 such columns carry a real FK; the rest
are unconstrained free text holding the auth uid. The 6 FK→`people.id` columns
(`subcontractor_sov_submissions.submitted_by`/`reviewed_by`, `project_role_members.
assigned_by`, `project_vendors.added_by`, `project_report_suggestions.reviewed_by`,
`user_schedule_notifications.resource_tasks_assigned_to_id`) are the danger set — one
careless `added_by: user.id` is a silent RLS-hidden row. Full map:
`docs/patterns/identity-id-shape-contract.md`. As of 2026-07-10 there are ZERO live
mismatches, but the safety is incidental (nulls / user-supplied ids), not enforced.

## Project intelligence / content retrieval

**Project content source** — the operation "get me the `document_metadata` content for
project X in window Y at granularity G." Owned by `frontend/src/lib/intelligence/content-
source.ts`, `getProjectContent(...)`, which absorbs the PM-APP client, the
`document_metadata` table, the date/created_at/captured_at window predicate, and
project_id → name resolution (with its int8-as-string coercion) behind one interface.
This is why the 2026-06/07 "RAG → full transcripts" change broke the assistant, the
daily-brief pages, and `/intelligence`: the switch had to be made in every copy. The seam
now owns the **`document_metadata` retrieval-and-window** decision; `brandon-daily-update`
routes through it and `canonical-operating-packet` reuses its exported `resolveProjectNames`.

**Scope of the content-source seam (ADR-0001).** A 2026-07-10 analysis corrected the
original "six shallow copies of one operation" framing: most of the apparent copies are
**legitimately different operations** that read different tables and MUST NOT be folded in,
or the module becomes a bloated multi-source god-module. Specifically OUT of scope:
`source_signal_candidates` readers (`canonical-operating-packet`, `daily-deep-read-
promotion` — RAG DB, `source_occurred_at`, and a *write* workflow), `rag_document_metadata`
readers (`daily-executive-brief.mjs` — RAG DB, `last_*` ingestion ladder), the per-source
RAG *answer builder* (`source-specific-rag` — live Graph merges, scope gating, ranking), and
financial/RFI readers (`financial.ts`, `project-data-tools.ts` — not content). The only true
`document_metadata` forks are in `ai/tools/project-tools.ts`; migrating them is a
**deliberate, verified behavior change** (the module's meeting lane is `type=meeting`-only and
always windows), NOT a mechanical swap — see ADR-0001 before re-attempting it.

**Content granularity** — the axis the content source is parameterised on, replacing the
implicit storage choice each caller hardcodes today:
- `chunks` — embedding-searched excerpts (the current `retrieveChunks` path).
- `full` — the COMPLETE transcript: concatenated `document_chunks` in `chunk_index` order,
  or the Storage `transcripts/*.md` markdown. The "full transcripts instead of RAG" path.
- `summary` — the lossy `document_metadata.summary`/`overview` auto-summary.

**Content window** — the normalized date range for a retrieval. The single source of truth
for the `date`/`created_at`/`captured_at`/`source_occurred_at`/`coalesce(...)` predicates
currently forked per caller. Owned by the content source, so project-name resolution
(and its int8-as-string coercion) happens exactly once.

**Operating record** — the full per-project intelligence row in `project_current_state`
(`current_summary`, `health_status`, `active_risks`, `open_decisions`, `needs_attention`,
`financial_read`, `schedule_read`, `field_read`, `source_confidence`, …), plus its sibling
snapshot/timeline projections. Written by ONE deep module,
`backend/.../intelligence/compiler.py::apply_source_operating_record_projection`. The
`/[projectId]/intelligence` page reads the whole record. The Daily Deep Read packet must
feed this writer through a **packet → operating-record adapter**, not a shallow `.mjs` that
updates only `current_summary` and leaves the rest of the record stale.
