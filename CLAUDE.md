## Core Principles

**Never ship silent failures. Never return generic errors. Never fix a recurring bug without a guardrail.**

Every issue falls into one of three buckets:
- **Should have been prevented** → add validation / constraints
- **Should have been caught pre-deploy** → add tests / CI
- **Should have been caught post-deploy** → add monitoring

After every bug fix, answer:
1. What would have caught this before production?
2. What guardrail am I adding so this class of bug cannot recur?
3. Does this reveal a pattern needing a system-level fix?

## How Work Gets Done (read before any multi-step task)

The **AI Engineering Playbook** is the single source of truth for *which* skill runs at
*which* step: `docs/alleato-os-docs/developer-docs/ai-engineering-playbook.mdx`.

Before starting any multi-step task:
1. **Classify the tier** — Quick / Standard / Large by uncertainty × blast radius (auth,
   RLS, migrations, money, RAG → always Large).
2. **Walk that tier's row** — Frame → Plan → Build → Verify → Test → Validate → Ship,
   running the **one** skill named in each cell and skipping blank cells.

Each skill owns exactly one (tier × step) cell — there is never a menu. Review =
`code-review`. Deep QA = `verify-feature`. UI judgment = `impeccable-alleato`. Always
close with `verification-before-completion`. Do not reach for retired/overlapping skills
listed in the playbook's retirement table.

## Project Overview

Next.js 15 frontend + Supabase backend construction project management platform. Mirrors Procore: budgets, contracts, change orders, directory, scheduling.

**Stack:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix, Framer Motion, TanStack Query, Zustand, Supabase (PostgreSQL/Auth/RLS), Python FastAPI, React Hook Form + Zod.

```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Root
npm run dev                 # frontend + backend
npm run build               # production build
npm run quality             # typecheck + lint
npm run quality:fix         # typecheck + lint + auto-fix

# frontend/
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run db:types            # REQUIRED before any DB work — regenerates database.types.ts
npm run check:routes        # verify no dynamic route conflicts
```

**Tests:**
```bash
npm run test                # Playwright E2E headless
npm run test:unit           # Jest unit
npx playwright test tests/e2e/<file>.spec.ts --headed
```

Auth pre-configured. Playwright session at `tests/.auth/user.json`. If expired, run `npx playwright test tests/auth.setup.ts` once.

---

## Verification Delegation (Mandatory)

Always delegate routine expensive verification to a lower-cost sub-agent when sub-agents are available. This includes full typechecks, lint/quality runs, production builds, full test suites, long crawls, and deployment log monitoring.

Main thread responsibilities:
- Implement code changes.
- Run only short targeted checks needed to make immediate decisions.
- Fix concrete blockers reported by verification.

Lower-cost sub-agent responsibilities:
- Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run quality`, `npm run build`, full Playwright/Jest suites, predeploy gates, and other long-running checks.
- Return only a compact report: pass/fail, exact failing command, concise error lines, likely owner file(s), and whether the failure is related to the current task or unrelated repo debt.

Do not burn a frontier/main conversation model on routine verification unless the user explicitly requests it or sub-agents are unavailable.

---

## External Service Ownership (Mandatory)

If a task requires an environment variable, provider key, deployment setting,
migration, backend service change, or operational configuration, do not ask the
user to do it when a CLI, API, MCP connector, or configured credential is
available. Use the tool directly and verify the result.

This applies to Vercel env vars/deployments, Sentry configuration, PostHog,
Supabase migrations and type generation, Render services/logs/deployments,
GitHub, Linear, Teams, Microsoft integrations, and similar configured systems.

Only call the work blocked when the tool is unavailable, auth/permissions fail,
or the needed secret value cannot be found in an existing secure source. When
blocked, state the exact missing capability or credential, the command/tool that
proved it, and the smallest setup action needed. Never expose secret values in
logs, docs, commits, or final responses.

---

## What the Toolchain Enforces

**You do not need to remember these — violating them blocks your commit or build.**

| What | Enforced by |
|------|------------|
| No `<button>` raw elements | ESLint `no-raw-button` → error on staged files |
| No hardcoded colors (hex, gray-*, blue-*) | ESLint `no-hardcoded-colors` → error on staged files |
| No `<h1>`/`<h2>` raw headings | ESLint `no-raw-heading` → global error |
| No raw `fetch("/api/...")` in components | ESLint `require-api-client` → error on staged files |
| No raw `fetch("https://...")` in API routes | ESLint `no-external-fetch-in-api-routes` → error on staged files |
| No raw `<TableBody>`/`<TableRow>` in pages | ESLint `no-raw-table-primitives` → error on staged files |
| No `<PageContainer>` + `<h1>` on new pages | ESLint `require-page-shell` → error on staged files |
| No raw `<Input placeholder="Search...">` in pages | ESLint `no-raw-search-input` → use `<ExpandingSearch>` |
| No `.from("nonexistent_table")` | pre-commit phantom-table check |
| No `[id]` dynamic route params | pre-commit `check:routes` |
| No `.md`/`.js`/`.ts` at project root | pre-commit root file guard |
| No server pages missing `force-dynamic` | pre-commit `check-server-prerender-safety.mjs` |
| No module-level server client init | pre-commit `check-no-module-level-server-init.mjs` |
| No new `eslint-disable` without approval | pre-commit `check-no-new-disables.mjs` |
| No new explicit `any` | pre-commit `check-no-new-any.mjs` |

When a lint rule blocks you, **fix the violation** — do not add `eslint-disable`.

## What Requires Judgment (Can't Be Automated)

### Database Work
Run `npm run db:types` before writing any query. Read `frontend/src/types/database.types.ts` to confirm the table, columns, and FK types exist. `projects.id` is INTEGER — not UUID.

### Route Naming
Use specific param names: `[projectId]`, `[contractId]`, `[commitmentId]`, `[invoiceId]`, `[companyId]`. Never `[id]`. Run `npm run check:routes` after creating any dynamic route.

### Form ↔ DB FK Validation
Before building any form with dropdowns: check which table the dropdown fetches from vs. which table the FK column points to. If they differ, add ID resolution in both read and write paths. Known mismatch (ONE, already resolved): `change_event_line_items.budget_code_id` → `budget_lines.id` while the dropdown returns `project_budget_codes.id` — resolved via `budget_lines.project_budget_code_id`. There is NO `project_cost_codes` table (it's `project_budget_codes`), and for commitments/direct-costs/prime-SOV `budget_code_id` already targets `project_budget_codes.id` (no resolution). `vendor_id` is NOT a mismatch — there is no `vendors` table; every `vendor_id` FK points to `companies.id` and the dropdown returns `companies.id` (vendor only needs the scope fix: inject the saved company as an option on edit). All verified live 2026-06-14. Full reference: `docs/patterns/form-id-mismatch-prevention.md`.

### Non-Negotiable UI Patterns (Zero Exceptions)

**Search inputs** — Every search field in a page or detail view uses `<ExpandingSearch>` from `@/components/ds`. It renders as a Search icon that expands on click. Raw `<Input placeholder="Search...">` is banned by ESLint gate 21. Never use a persistent open input box for search.

**Table column headers** — Column headers NEVER wrap to multiple lines. `whitespace-nowrap` is baked into `DataTable`'s `<th>` — do not override it. If a header is too long, shorten the label; never widen the column or remove the nowrap.

**Section heading actions** — Any button in a `SectionRuleHeading` `actions` slot MUST use `<SectionAction>` from `@/components/layout`. Never pass `<Button variant="ghost">` or plain text — ghost buttons are visually indistinguishable from heading text. `SectionAction` enforces `variant="outline" size="sm"` automatically.

```tsx
// Correct
import { SectionAction, SectionRuleHeading } from "@/components/layout";
<SectionRuleHeading label="Contacts" actions={<SectionAction onClick={...}>Add contact</SectionAction>} />

// Wrong — ghost button looks like plain text
<SectionRuleHeading label="Contacts" actions={<Button variant="ghost" size="sm">Add contact</Button>} />
```

**Detail page two-column layout** — Any detail page content area with a sidebar MUST use `<DetailLayout sidebar={...}>` from `@/components/layout`. Never hand-roll `grid-cols-1 xl:grid-cols-[...]`. ESLint rule `no-raw-detail-grid` enforces this. Single-column detail pages (no sidebar) use `<DetailLayout>` without the `sidebar` prop, or just `<ContentSectionStack>` directly.

```tsx
// Correct
import { DetailLayout } from "@/components/layout";
<DetailLayout sidebar={<MyFinancialSidebar />}>
  <DetailPanel>...</DetailPanel>
</DetailLayout>

// Wrong — raw grid
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 xl:grid-cols-[minmax(0,1fr)_300px]">
  <div>...</div>
  <aside>...</aside>
</div>
```

### Cache Clearing
Before debugging any 404 or routing issue with new files:
```bash
cd frontend && rm -rf .next
```
Never debug routing before clearing the cache.

### Browser Verification
Never claim UI work complete without verifying in `agent-browser`. Take a screenshot, read it, then report.

### Visual Proof on Completion (Mandatory — `.claude/rules/VISUAL-PROOF-GATE.md`)
A task cannot be marked completed or closed out without **showing the user visual
proof it works**: a screenshot of the fixed behavior per item (for data-parity
fixes, both sides — e.g. each drilldown panel AND the table value it matches).
Only if the fix is genuinely not visual (rare): a link to the live page; last
resort: a link to the file plus a screenshot of the edited code. Passing tests,
green CI, and a text summary are never sufficient. Full rule:
`.claude/rules/VISUAL-PROOF-GATE.md`.

### Authentication
Never ask the user to log in. Credentials are in `.env`:
- App: `TEST_USER_1` / `TEST_PASSWORD_1`
- Procore crawlers: `PROCORE_USER` / `PROCORE_PASSWORD`
- Playwright: uses `tests/.auth/user.json`

### Bug Fixes
A fix is not complete without: a test that would have caught it, a validation rule preventing the bad input, a smoke test entry, or a guardrail in the shared wrapper. `scripts/api-smoke-contracts.mjs` is the first place to add regression coverage for endpoint failures.

### UI Signal-to-Noise
Remove anything that earns no place. No borders around sections — use spacing and tonal backgrounds. No labels next to self-explanatory icons. Three stacked buttons should be a `<Select>`. When in doubt, remove.

For any user-facing frontend page, feature, component, form, table, AI surface,
dashboard, executive brief, project intelligence view, or visual polish task,
treat Impeccable's Alleato product noise gate as active even when the user does
not mention Impeccable.

Canonical reference: `.agents/skills/impeccable/reference/alleato-product-noise-gate.md`
Direct command: `impeccable noise-gate [target]`

**Noise Gate Log (case law — `docs/design/noise-gate-log.md`):** READ IT before any
frontend work — it holds every concrete element Megan has flagged as noise and the
binding rule extracted from each. When Megan calls anything "noise" / "visual noise" /
"clutter," you MUST append a new dated row to that log in the same turn (next sequential
ID, specific complaint → general rule) and then apply the fix. This is non-negotiable —
the log is how the noise gate learns. Current distilled rules: secondary add action =
bare plus icon (never a labeled/bordered button); never stack a subtitle under a label;
no decorative icons (icon only when it's the sole affordance); empty field renders
nothing, never a "—" dash; sections have no background fill, no border, no card wrapper —
separate with spacing only.

Required behavior:
- Before adding UI, identify the primary user, primary job, primary decision,
  Tier 1 content, content hidden until requested, removal candidates, primary
  action, and failure-loudly behavior.
- The burden of proof is on addition. Any new visual element must improve
  comprehension, decision quality, task speed, error prevention, source
  confidence, or recovery.
- Remove before restyling. Do not make noisy elements prettier until they prove
  they deserve to exist.
- Do not ship nested cards, wrapper panels, decorative badges/icons, helper
  widgets, duplicate CTAs, decorative dashboards, or visual filler.
- Final frontend responses must include noise gate pass/fail, what was removed
  or simplified, remaining risk, and regression guardrail.

Never add unsolicited helper panels, finder widgets, explanatory blocks, banners, callouts, or "nice to have" modules to production pages. Every visible element must answer a proven user workflow need. If it does not make the primary task faster, clearer, or safer, remove it.

Do not use visual noise as a substitute for product thinking. Secondary search boxes, ownership finders, summary strips, empty helper text, badges, icons, and extra sections require a concrete answer to: who uses it, when they use it, what decision it improves, and why the existing table toolbar/filter/search/detail flow cannot own it. If those answers are not clear, do not add the UI.

### Chat UI
No `<Alert>`/`<Card>` wrappers. No `Bot` icon — use "A" or `BriefcaseIcon`. User messages: `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`. Loading: animated dots.

---

## Supabase Client
- **Client components:** `import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client"`
- **Server/API routes:** `import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server"`
- Never install `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` — conflicts with `@supabase/ssr`.

## Two Supabase Projects (RAG migration 2026-05-15)

This app uses **two** Supabase projects. Using the wrong one will silently give stale data or fail on write.

| Project | Ref | What lives here |
|---------|-----|-----------------|
| **PM APP** (primary app DB) | `lgveqfnpkxvzbnnwuled` | All app tables: projects, contracts, budgets, RFIs, submittals, emails, meetings, insights, tasks, etc. Reached via `SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`. |
| **AI Database** (RAG vector store) | `fqcvmfqldlewvbsuxdvz` | **Active** `document_chunks`, `rag_document_metadata`, `rag_pipeline_state`. Reached via `RAG_SUPABASE_URL` and the `get_rag_read_client()` / `get_rag_write_client()` helpers. |

**Legacy tables in PM APP (do not write):** `document_chunks` and `rag_pipeline_state` still exist in the PM APP project but were migrated on 2026-05-15. They are now **read-only at the database level** — a `BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE` trigger raises `LEGACY TABLE: ...` with a pointer to the new location. Reads still work for historical queries. Never re-enable writes here; point clients at the AI Database project instead.

**Rule of thumb:** anything RAG/embeddings/chunks → AI Database (use the RAG client). Everything else → PM APP (use the regular Supabase client).

---

## Key Patterns

**API fetch (components/hooks):** `apiFetch` from `@/lib/api-client` — never raw `fetch`.

**External service calls (API routes):** `fetchWithGuardrails` from `@/lib/fetch-with-guardrails` — never raw `fetch`.

**Table pages:** `UnifiedTablePage` + `useUnifiedTableState` from `@/components/tables/unified`. Reference: `frontend/src/app/(main)/[projectId]/commitments/page.tsx`.

**Page layout:** `<PageShell variant="table|dashboard|form|detail|content">` from `@/components/layout`.

**Design system components:** Check `frontend/src/components/ds/` before writing any UI. Reference: `frontend/src/components/ds/GOLDEN-EXAMPLES.tsx`.

**Data fetching:** Hooks in `hooks/use-*.ts` wrap Supabase with React Query.

**New CRUD features:** `/create-feature <EntityName>` instead of writing from scratch.

---

## Reference Docs

- **`docs/architecture/PROJECT-MAP.md` — READ FIRST.** Auto-generated surface inventory of the whole app: every UI route, every API endpoint (with HTTP methods), and every AI tool (with descriptions). This is the map of what already exists — check it before assuming a page/route/tool needs to be built. Regenerated by `npm run map:project`; never edit by hand. Kept fresh by a pre-commit gate.
- `DESIGN.md` (repo root) — design system (single source of truth)
- `docs/design/table-system.md` — UnifiedTablePage API
- `docs/design/form-design-system/FORM-SYSTEM.md` — RHF + Zod patterns
- `docs/patterns/` — known error patterns (auth, DB, API routing, integrations)
- `docs/architecture/COMMUNICATIONS-DATA-PIPELINE.md` — email/sync/AI pipeline
- `docs/architecture/AI-RAG-ARCHITECTURE.md` — AI/RAG architecture (hand-edited; kept fresh by `.claude/rules/RAG-DOCS-GATE.md`)
- `docs/architecture/tables.yaml` — **source of truth** for table metadata (hand-edited)
- `docs/architecture/TABLE-LIST.md` — **auto-generated** live list of every table with status + rows. Regenerated by `npm run db:inventory`. Never edit by hand.
- `docs/architecture/TABLE-INVENTORY.md` — narrative + dated corrections log (hand-edited)

## RAG / table docs are kept fresh by a gate, not by trust

Whenever you touch RAG code, the embedding pipeline, RAG migrations, or anything under `frontend/src/lib/ai/`, `backend/src/services/pipeline/`, `backend/src/services/integrations/microsoft_graph/`, or `alleato-ai/alleato_ai/tools/`, you MUST update at least one of:
- `docs/architecture/AI-RAG-ARCHITECTURE.md` (when architecture/tools/flow changes), OR
- `docs/architecture/tables.yaml` (when tables/columns/purpose changes) — then run `npm run db:inventory` so `TABLE-LIST.md` regenerates.

A pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit-rag-docs`) enforces this — it blocks any commit that stages RAG-touching code without staging at least one of those sources, AND blocks any commit that stages `tables.yaml` without the regenerated `TABLE-LIST.md`. Full rule: `.claude/rules/RAG-DOCS-GATE.md`. Do not bypass with `--no-verify`; use the `[skip-rag-docs]` commit-subject token only for genuine no-ops.

---

## Agentation Watch Mode

When I say "watch mode", call `agentation_watch_annotations` in a loop. For each annotation: acknowledge it, make the fix, resolve with a summary. Continue until I say stop.

---

## Saved Research Snapshots (read before re-crawling)

Deep architectural analysis is expensive. Before spawning research agents, check if a memory snapshot already covers the domain:

- **Financial domain** (estimates, prime contracts, commitments, budget): `~/.claude/projects/-Users-meganharrison-Documents-alleato-pm/memory/architecture_financial_domain.md` — full FK map, table columns, API routes, tech debt. Verified 2026-05-15.
- **Index:** `~/.claude/projects/-Users-meganharrison-Documents-alleato-pm/memory/MEMORY.md`

**Light-refresh protocol:** Load the snapshot → run `git log --oneline --since=<snapshot date> -- <relevant files>` → read only changed files → cross-analyze deltas. This saves ~400k tokens vs a full re-crawl.

After any deep research session, save a new snapshot to the memory directory following the pattern in `feedback_reuse_deep_research.md`.

---

## Git Workflow

**This app is live in production. `main` is production.** When *you* (a human or an
interactive agent) make a change, never commit directly to `main` and never push straight
to it — branch, open a PR, and let the preview deploy gate it (steps below).

**The Codex automation lane** (`.github/workflows/codex-fix-issue.yml`) still goes through
a PR — it never pushes to `main` directly (the branch ruleset requires status checks that a
direct push can't satisfy, and past direct-push attempts corrupted `main`). What it *decides
per issue* is the **merge** posture, not whether to bypass the PR: Eve triage classifies the
issue's risk, then a diff-risk gate re-checks that against the actual change Codex produced.
A fix gets a normal PR with **auto-merge enabled** (it lands automatically once the required
checks pass) only when it is triaged low-risk **and** its diff avoids risky surfaces (API
routes, the Supabase/auth layer, financial/contract code) and stays small (≤6 files, ≤400
lines). Anything else opens as a **draft PR for human review**. The gate can only downgrade
auto-merge → review, never the reverse. Either way the ruleset's required checks are the
gate — nothing reaches production unchecked.

**Branch per task.** Start every task from fresh `main` on its own short-lived branch,
push it, test on the Vercel **preview deployment** Vercel auto-builds for the branch/PR,
then open a PR and merge to `main` (the merge is what deploys to production).

```bash
# 1. Start from latest main
git checkout main && git pull

# 2. New branch (feat/ for features & general work, fix/ for bug fixes)
git checkout -b feat/{short-slug}            # or fix/issue-{number}-{short-slug}

# 3. Work, commit
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: <description>"

# 4. Push + open PR (push triggers a Vercel preview deploy)
git push -u origin feat/{short-slug}
gh pr create --title "feat: <description>" --base main --body "<what/why + test plan>"

# 5. Test the preview URL, get review, merge to main, then delete the branch
```

Branch naming: `feat/{slug}` for features/refactors/infra, `fix/issue-{number}-{slug}` for
GitHub-issue fixes (e.g. `fix/issue-427-direct-costs-panel`). For issue fixes, the PR body
must contain `Closes #{number}` so GitHub auto-closes the issue on merge.

**Keep branches short-lived and delete them after merge** — do not let a long-lived
`develop`/staging branch drift behind `main`. Drift causes painful multi-file merge
conflicts (and is what motivated this workflow). If a branch must live a while, merge
`main` into it frequently (daily-ish), never let it fall many commits behind.

**For your own work, never** commit to `main` directly or push a feature/fix branch onto
`main` — the PR + preview deploy is the record and the safety gate. The Codex automation
lane also goes through a PR; its only special behavior is auto-merging the low-risk ones
once checks pass (described above).

---

## Behavioral Rules

- Use MCP, CLI, or Bash — never tell the user to do something manually.
- When you find a bug during any task, fix it or spawn a sub-agent. No "improvement opportunities" lists.
- `cd X && command` chains fail in zsh — use absolute paths.
- **START of session:** Read `WORKING_CONTEXT.md`.
- **END of session:** Update `WORKING_CONTEXT.md`.
- **Resuming from a context summary:** Execute every pending task listed in the summary immediately and completely — fix, commit, deploy, verify — without asking. If a deploy doesn't auto-trigger, detect it and trigger it via the Render/Vercel API. Use `spawn_task` for any optional follow-up items discovered along the way. The user should come back to "done", not to a question.
